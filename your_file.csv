He argues that birds attending ant raids are not so much competing as coexisting, sharing resources, perhaps even facilitating one another’s participation—deliberately or not. “Having other birds around may be an advantage because there are more eyes and ears to detect predators,” he says. “Food is usually abundant at a raid, so the costs of allowing other birds to attend may be low, favoring more positive interactions.”
			 Anyone who has ever watched a dual between two rufous hummingbirds at a nectar feeder, or a pack of gulls battling for a stray french fry, or a pair of starlings bloodying each other over just about anything knows the potential for fierce competition in the bird world.

The behavior occurs in birds that have a brain big for their body size (ravens have among the largest relative brain size of any bird), a long juvenile period when youngsters hang around with their parents (ravens spend at least five months with their family), and a habit of exploiting all available food resources (ravens specialize in being food generalists). Most birds that engage in social play have a complex social system. Ducks do something called coordinated loafing, hanging out together. But real social play exists mostly among birds that live in complex societies where alliances are fluid and constantly shifting, like ravens and Australian magpies."

A sterilizing cure is just what it sounds like: It “sterilizes” the body. This means that no trace of the virus can be found. A functional cure, on the other hand, doesn’t get rid of all traces of the pathogen. But a cure of either type means that the person does not require medication or therapy. Both types of cure mean a person doesn’t have to worry about the virus growing in his body or destroying her immune system. It is also highly unlikely that the person could infect anyone else.
			 In people with a functional cure, lying hidden in their bodies, detectable only by the most sensitive tests, will be traces of the virus. Persons receiving this treatment are cured, but they will always carry a small piece of the virus with them. For most, it doesn’t matter if the cure they receive is sterilizing or functional; they simply want to be cured. Both Berlin patients received a functional cure for HIV, which is to say they both still carry the virus inside them and always will. This may sound like a strange cure, but it isn’t.

It can slide two ways. Humans scream when they’re distressed, shocked, excited, or in pain. Humans also scream in order to alert other humans to their plight. It’s not always easy to disentangle cause and effect, even if one asks the distressed human outright. With plants it’s even harder. Perhaps the fraught question of whether plants warn one another of an aphid attack or just happen to overhear their neighbor’s chemical shrieks is the wrong thing to ask. As Kiers remarked, “It’s the narrative that we tell that needs to be examined. I’d really love to get past the language and try to understand the phenomenon.” Once again, it may be more helpful to ask why this behavior has evolved in the first place: Who stands to benefit?"

“Oh, that is a piece of bad luck,” says Caesar, and there’s a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in agreement, a few have even given agonized cries.

 I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do!
 I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember there’s almost no one left.
Peeta, who’s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts I’ve had about him dissipate because if either of us took the other’s life now we’d be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I’d loathe any tribute who didn’t immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case — being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 — it’s an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors.
The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our “romance” must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I’ve done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he’s done in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me.
The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it.

Not when I’ve disobeyed his orders or puked on him, not even when Gale broke his nose. But he’s angry when he returns from his phone call with the president. The first thing he does is instruct Soldier Jackson, his second in command, to set up a two-person, round-the-clock guard on Peeta. Then he takes me on a walk, weaving through the sprawling tent encampment until our squad is far behind us.
“He’ll try and kill me anyway,” I say. “Especially here. Where there are so many bad memories to set him off.”
“I’ll keep him contained, Katniss,” says Boggs.
“Why does Coin want me dead now?” I ask.
“She denies she does,” he answers.
“But we know it’s true,” I say. “And you must at least have a theory.”
Boggs gives me a long, hard look before he answers. “Here’s as much as I know. The president doesn’t like you. She never did. It was Peeta she wanted rescued from the arena, but no one else agreed. It made matters worse when you forced her to give the other victors immunity. But even that could be overlooked in view of how well you’ve performed.”
“Then what is it?” I insist.

“Sometime in the near future, this war will be resolved. A new leader will be chosen,” says Boggs.
I roll my eyes. “Boggs, no one thinks I’m going to be the leader.”
“No. They don’t,” he agrees. “But you’ll throw support to someone. Would it be President Coin? Or someone else?”
“I don’t know. I’ve never thought about it,” I say.
“If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’re the face of the rebellion. You may have more influence than any other single person,” says Boggs. “Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”
“So she’ll kill me to shut me up.” The minute I say the words, I know they’re true.
“She doesn’t need you as a rallying point now. As she said, your primary objective, to unite the districts, has succeeded,” Boggs reminds me. “These current propos could be done without you. There’s only one last thing you could do to add fire to the rebellion.”
“Die,” I say quietly.
“Yes. Give us a martyr to fight for,” says Boggs. “But that’s not going to happen under my watch, Soldier Everdeen. I’m planning for you to have a long life.”
“Why?” This kind of thinking will only bring him trouble. “You don’t owe me anything.”
“Because you’ve earned it,” he says. “Now get back to your squad.”
I know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking his neck out for me, but really I’m just frustrated. I mean, how can I steal his Holo and desert now? Betraying him was complicated enough without this whole new layer of debt. I already owe him for saving my life."

annotation,Le loup solitaire,Suzanne Martel,2024-03-05T05:12:49.233,2024-03-05T05:12:49Z,Attention au detail,"La chambre de Luc ouvre sur un balcon d'où l’on surplombe la plage. La mer se déroule jusqu'à l'infini dans un grondement perpétuel. Au loin, on voit croiser les voiles rouges rectangulaires des dows de pêche locaux et les triangles bleus ou blancs des voiliers de plaisance.

    Le soleil filtré par les jalousies dessine des bandes d'ombre et de lumière sur le tapis fleuri. Avec ses cretonnes claires, ses meubles de bois blancs et ses aquarelles de paysages européens, la chambre est une oasis de paix et de sécurité, juste assez impersonnelle pour ne pas effaroucher son nouvel occupant. Sans même s'en rendre compte, Arnaud redoutait un décor oriental, rappel de réalités non encore absorbées.

    Deux grands lits dominent la pièce, démontrant que Luc avait prévu le partage. Le coup de la clé était une taquinerie, un signe de bienvenue. La chambre est dans un ordre parfait, comme tous les locaux habités par le diplomate méthodique. Sur la table de chevet, des verres, une carafe d'eau, des bouteilles et des cigarettes, des clés d'automobiles côtoient une enveloppe adressée au Petit, surnom exécré et inévitable.

    Aussi laconique en style qu'en paroles, Luc annonce: «Paul absent pour la semaine. Moi pour deux jours. Ma garde-robe est à ta disposition. Les chaussures de droite sont à ta pointure. Ma voiture est au garage de l'hôtel. Argent déposé à ton nom au bureau du gérant. Observe le décorum, replonge-toi dans la civilisation. Oublie dix mois de sécheresse dans la mer. Lucky.»

    «Quel poète», pense Arnaud, surpris comme toujours par la perspicacité et la prévoyance de son frère. Celui-ci a même eu soin de tracer un petit schéma des vitesses compliquées de la lourde voiture sport mise à sa disposition pendant son séjour à Ursique."

One thinks of the executioner who mixed a brew for Socrates, of the guys who assembled the cross, of the Chinese chemist who noticed that certain elements could be made to go bang, of the chambermaids trying to pick up after a gang of politicians in a few Philadelphia inns in 1776.

And when the story was finished, I knew I still had not answered to my own satisfaction my first question: Who owns the child’s body and makes decisions about it? The society, the parent or the child? Gene therapy and DNA manipulation are no longer on the distant horizon, but are here amongst us now. For me, the question seems more urgent and the answer as elusive as ever."

For Neil, however, Hell bears no resemblance whatsoever to the mortal plane. His eternal body has well-formed legs, but he’s scarcely aware of them; his eyes have been restored, but he can’t bear to open them. Just as seeing Heaven’s light gave him an awareness of God’s presence in all things in the mortal plane, so it has made him aware of God’s absence in all things in Hell. Everything Neil sees, hears, or touches causes him distress, and unlike in the mortal plane this pain is not a form of God’s love, but a consequence of His absence. Neil is experiencing more anguish than was possible when he was alive, but his only response is to love God. Neil still loves Sarah, and misses her as much as he ever did, and the knowledge that he came so close to rejoining her only makes it worse. He knows his being sent to Hell was not a result of anything he did; he knows there was no reason for it, no higher purpose being served. None of this diminishes his love for God. If there were a possibility that he could be admitted to Heaven and his suffering would end, he would not hope for it; such desires no longer occur to him. Neil even knows that by being beyond God’s awareness, he is not loved by God in return. This doesn’t affect his feelings either, because unconditional love asks nothing, not even that it be returned.

I’ve taken a permanent job for a yachting magazine where I spend my time on the surface, shooting sailboat races and charter boat ads with lovely ladies in bikinis. Even there, though, I see the occasional ghost, perched on the rail of a passing merchant vessel, waiting on a pier, awash and alone in the surf. They’re easily avoided. But the ghosts below the surface are all too real for me.  And far too insistent that I join them.   for

The mansion had changed hands dozens of times, and people called it Rockfall—despite the newest owner’s attempt over the last decade to rename it the incredibly boring Hadinal Keep.

He noticed that other medical pioneers such as Louis Pasteur had reported similar findings with erysipelas and began to suspect that postsurgical infections in some cases actually helped patients recover from cancer. Coley hypothesized that the infections triggered an immune response that not only ridded the body of the invading bacteria, as a fever is intended to do, but also stimulated the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.
 Coley immediately tested his theory on a cancer patient on whom all other treatments had failed, injecting him directly with live streptococcus bacteria. The man, who had a tumor the size of a chicken egg on his neck, could barely speak or swallow and had been given only weeks to live. After the injection, his fever flared and he grew alarmingly ill. But then, as he recovered from the infection, he and Coley watched the tumor dissolve and disappear. The man survived and went home cancer-free.
 The implications were astounding—somehow, the body’s natural processes of fighting infection were also breaking down cancerous tumors, liquefying and flushing them away as if they’d never been there.
 Rereading the story of Dr. Coley and Bessie Dashiell, I was struck by the visionary nature of his discoveries, so long ago. Coley, now called “the father of immunotherapy,” uncovered something essential about the power of the human immune system—a way to potentially turn it on to fight an incurable illness. He went on to develop a mixture of dead bacteria that he began to use as a cancer treatment, safer to use since this mixture was less likely to make sick people sicker to the point of death. But the idea of introducing “bad” bacteria into the body was difficult for people to accept.

The death rate from childbed fever immediately plummeted from a soaring high of close to 25 percent down to only 1 to 2 percent.
 It was a dramatic and undeniable success. But the medical world couldn’t, or wouldn’t, accept the theory that diseases were spread in this way. First of all, the notion that doctors carried some kind of infectious substance on their hands was laughed off as utter nonsense—to think there were tiny, invisible creatures covering surfaces and flying through the air spreading illness seemed absurd. And second, the idea that doctors had been responsible for their patients’ suffering and death all along was impossible to believe, anathema to the image of physicians as saviors. “Doctors are gentlemen,” said one prominent Philadelphia physician, “and a gentleman’s hands are clean.”
 Semmelweis was mocked and threatened and eventually run out of the medical profession entirely.

     A lot of people don’t believe in yellow-spotted lizards either, but if one bites you, it doesn’t make a difference whether you believe in it or not.

     The lizard is from six to ten inches long and has big red eyes. In truth, its eyes are yellow, and it is the skin around the eyes which is red, but everyone always speaks of its red eyes. It also has black teeth and a milky white tongue.

     Looking at one, you would have thought that it should have been named a “red-eyed” lizard, or a “black-toothed” lizard, or perhaps a “white-tongued” lizard.

     If you’ve ever been close enough to see the yellow spots, you are probably dead.

     The yellow-spotted lizards like to live in holes, which offer shade from the sun and protection from predatory birds. Up to twenty lizards may live in one hole.

 Once, there was a cabal of merchants and scientists whose purpose was to make money and improve the lot of humankind. They invented Time Travel and Immortality. Now, I was taught that they invented Time Travel first and developed Immortals so they could send people safely back through the years.
 In reality it was the other way around. The process for Immortality was developed first. In order to test it, they had to invent Time Travel.
 It worked like this: they would send a team of doctors into the past, into 1486 for example, and select some lucky native of that time and confer immortality on him. Then they’d go back to their own time and see if their test case was still around. Had he survived the intervening nine hundred years? He had? How wonderful. Were there any unpleasant side effects? There were? Oops. They’d go back to the drawing board and then back to 1486 to try the new, improved process on another native. Then they’d go home again, to see how this one turned out. Still not perfect? They’d try again. After all, they were only expending a few days of their own time.

Even in the earliest work on E. coli, though, it seemed that something else was going on. They were also attracted to chemicals they could not eat. Biologists who work on these organisms are more and more inclined to see the senses of bacteria as attuned to the presence and activities of other cells around them, not just to washes of edible and inedible chemicals. The receptors on the surfaces of bacterial cells are sensitive to many things, and these include chemicals that bacteria themselves tend to excrete for various reasons—sometimes just as overflow of metabolic processes. This may not sound like much, but it opens an important door. Once the same chemicals are being sensed and produced, there is the possibility of coordination between cells. We have reached the birth of social behavior.
 An example is quorum sensing. If a chemical is both produced and sensed by a particular kind of bacterium, it can be used by those bacteria to assess how many individuals of the same kind are around. By doing this, they can work out whether enough bacteria are nearby for it to be worthwhile to produce a chemical that does its job only if many cells make it at once."

 A bacterium is so small that its sensors alone can give it no indication of the direction that a good or bad chemical is coming from. To overcome this problem, the bacterium uses time to help it deal with space. The cell is not interested in how much of a chemical is present at any given moment, but rather in whether that concentration is increasing or decreasing. After all, if the cell swam in a straight line simply because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it’s pointing. The bacterium solves this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanism registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem better now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it’s preferable to change course."

 Communication in everyday life serves both roles: there is a sexton-and-Revere or sensory-motor role, based on a division between those who see and those who act, and there is a purely coordinative role, as seen in the rowers. Both of these roles can be played at the same time and there’s no conflict between them. Getting a boat to move requires the coordination of micro-actions, but someone also needs to watch where the boat is going.

They rightly point out that it’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking of each “action” as a single unit, in which case the only problem left to solve is coordinating these acts with the senses, working out when to do X rather than Y. As organisms get bigger and can do more, that picture becomes more and more inaccurate. It ignores the problem of how an organism is able to do X or Y in the first place.

All the farmers in the village raised fruit, but their orchards were usually no more than a dozen trees, all of traditional heirloom varieties.

Farmers battled Terran immigrants like tarnished plant bugs, sawflies, wooly aphids, coddling moths, leafrollers, lesser apple worms, and the arch enemy: plum curculio. There were mildews, rusts, rots, cankers, blotches and blights to contend with as well. The long growing season of fruit trees made them vulnerable to successive attacks.

       You don’t always know where a story comes from, but in this case I can pinpoint it exactly – August 26, 1981. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena had invited a bunch of
      science fiction writers to come witness the Voyager 2 flyby of Saturn.

       It was immensely exciting, but there were long periods when nothing was happening. Jerry Pournelle had a cooler full of iced beer in the back of his Jeep, and I was happy to join him for one
      in the California sun.

       We got to talking about the movie Star Wars, and I expressed admiration for the tavern scene, all those weird aliens drinking impossible stuff, munching on raw meat, and so forth.
      Jerry said hell, that’s nothing new. Every science fiction writer has done the aliens-in-a-bar scene a dozen times.

       As a matter of fact, I hadn’t. So I went home and did it.

Schwing brings out a wooden box he used in an elaborate experiment some years earlier to test the kea’s cognitive skills and ability to cooperate. The wooden box is raised on legs and bottomed by a tray that drops down if properly triggered. In the experiment, the tray was loaded with treats—parrot pellets stuck there with cream cheese. Attached to the tray were four separate chains threaded through holes in the side of the box. To release the tray and access the treats, four kea had to pull the different chains simultaneously—and continue to pull together until the tray released. If only one bird pulled at a time, the chain would slide out without moving the tray. If any of the birds lets go too soon, the tray would pop back up out of reach.
			 The results were impressive. Kermit led the way, and after a little training, the other kea quickly learned to pull together—and to persist—so they could all get their treats.
			 A couple of years later, a film and photography crew from the National Geographic Society wanted to take photos of the kea cooperatively solving the wooden box and strings puzzle. “I didn’t have high hopes,” Schwing recalls. The kea hadn’t seen the puzzle box in over a year. But he took what he thought were his four best birds and put them in a waiting compartment while the crews set up the cameras.
			 “It was breeding season, so there was some tension—they were chasing each other around in there,” he says. “And I thought, ‘Oh, this is not looking good.’ But the moment I opened the gate for them to get access to the box, they fell in line, one after another, not even a body length in distance between beak and tail. And in this group of four they walked right over to the box, past the photographers, past the lights, past everything, walked right up and found their places and pulled on the chains.

The mismatch between the fairy-wrens’ social mating system—the birds form lifelong pair-bonds—and their sexual mating system is nothing short of spectacular.

In human speech, words referring to a specific object usually evoke a visual mental image. Think moon or dog or snake. Suzuki found evidence that Japanese tit alarm calls create just this kind of search image in the heads of listening birds.

This was the accepted wisdom when Naomi Langmore of Australian National University started working on cuckoos in Australia in the early 2000s. But the more field studies she looked at, the more evidence she found against this. In fact, most Australian host species tended not to reject cuckoo eggs. “Which is completely counter to evolutionary theory,” she says. “The arms race between them should exert powerful pressure on the host both to recognize foreign eggs and to reject them.”
			 Were the host birds down under really incapable of distinguishing between their own eggs and a cuckoo’s?
			 To find out, Langmore made a slew of little plastic eggs that were bright blue—different from the egg color of any host species in Australia—and placed them in the nests of a lot of different host species. She found that host birds that built cup-shaped nests could easily recognize and reject those plastic eggs. But birds that built dome-shaped nests, such as fairy-wrens, could not. This makes sense: Dome nests are dark places where it’s tough to make visual distinctions.
			 Then Langmore made the sort of discovery that shocks scientists and makes research on this weird system of parenting so rewarding. When she looked more closely at birds that build these dome nests, primarily fairy-wrens and thornbills, she found to her amazement that although they couldn’t reject cuckoo eggs, they had a very fine ability to recognize cuckoo chicks—and reject them. The little host birds would either seize the intruding chick and drag it out of the nest or abandon the nest altogether to start a new breeding attempt."

During their first winter of life, more than a third are taken by owls, pine martens, sparrowhawks, and especially goshawks, which account for 70 percent of all kills. Goshawks hunt in three phases—perching in a tree and scanning for prey, making search flights to the next perch, where they scan some more, and then, finally, bulleting through the brush to take their prey by surprise. The jays have evolved a sophisticated system of three different alarm calls specifying the hunting phase of the hawk—whether it’s perched, searching for prey, or attacking.

She calls him Triple Blue and he sings especially beautifully, “a truly astounding free-flowing improvisation full of loud, flamboyant mimicry,” she says. “For lyrebirds, the evidence is strong that mimicry in males is sexually selected.” Belting out mimicry to females he can’t see is a male’s way of advertising himself, saying, “Look how clever I am, how accurate and versatile my mimicry is, how strong is my voice. I’m very intelligent (the accuracy of my mimicry shows that I have a good brain), and I can sing for hours a day.” As Dalziell points out, the female alone sees to all the parental care—building the nest, brooding and raising the chick, defending her feeding territory. All she needs from a male is sperm. A choosy female measures a prospective mate by his spectacular plumage, his dancing ability, and his loud, complex, flamboyant song, including the versatility and accuracy of his mimicry and the carrying capacity of his calls. All of these traits may act as “honest” signals of a male’s quality—his ability to learn, his strength and vigor, his genes, the conditions in which he was raised. “It’s probably good for females to mate with males that are proficient vocal mimics so that their offspring are also competent at using mimicry to defend nests if they’re female and to obtain mates if they’re male,” says Dalziell. A female will listen to various males for months and months before she settles on a mate. Only the best performers get to pass on their genes.

Humans have three types of color-receptive cones in our retinas, blue, green, and red. Birds have a fourth color cone that is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths. We are thus “trichromatic,” and most diurnal birds are “tetrachromatic.” With their extra UV cone, birds can distinguish shades of color we can’t tell apart, allowing them to spot prey well camouflaged against the uniform background of a grassy field or leafy forest floor, and to detect things invisible to us—like the trail of urine left by a vole.

Cyclist magpies swoop only cyclists. And then there are magpies that specialize in hammering posties—the postal workers on little motorbikes that go whizzing up the street, postbox to postbox. In his research, Jones found that magpies that attack cyclists will attack any cyclist. And those that attack posties will attack any postie.

Or maybe it’s that predators are less of a threat.

For kea, with their curved beaks, this is no easy task. They can’t hold a tool in alignment with their heads the way a New Caledonian crow can, so they have less control over the tip of the tool. Kermit nailed the solution with a unique routine that involved holding the tool in his beak laterally, then switching it to his foot and adjusting it with his beak until he could hold it in proper position with his foot, and then directing the tool through the opening with his beak and maneuvering it until he hit the reward.

They have boundless curiosity and no fear. Whereas a raven will stare at an unfamiliar object for weeks before touching it, any new thing sparks instant investigation by a kea: “Hmm, what’s this?

The truth is, those naked heads relieved of adornment are extremely hygienic—gory stuff just doesn’t stick. And it’s a lie that vultures particularly relish a ripe, rotting mess. They actually prefer fresher carrion. As such, they perform a vital, and vastly underrated, service to the environment: the quick, competent cleanup and recycling of dead creatures.
			 Vultures are nature’s sanitary workers. Because they feed in groups and eat rapidly—each bird downing more than two pounds of meat a minute—they can rapidly consume whole carcasses. Their guts are acidic enough to destroy the agents of disease, such as cholera and anthrax, so there’s little risk of spreading contamination from an infected carcass. That’s not the case with more leisurely mammalian carrion eaters such as rats or dogs or coyotes.
			 What happens when vultures vanish, people learned the hard way in India and Pakistan more than a decade ago. There, a mass die-off of old-world vultures caused by an arthritis drug in the flesh of dead cattle led to an eruption of rabies.

It’s the only species other than humans to make and use hook tools, little sticks with a hook on the end, which the bird uses to extract grubs and other invertebrates from tree holes and the nooks and crannies of plants. The crows also make very elaborate hooked tools from the leaves of pandanus trees. Pandanus leaves have little barbs along the edge, which the bird uses to latch onto its grubs. It takes a lot of complicated steps to make these tools. The birds make several methodical cuts and tears in the leaf before removing the fully crafted tool from the leaf. This suggests they have an image of the tool in their heads before they actually start making it.

By the last trimester of pregnancy, a human fetus can memorize what it hears from the external world and is especially sensitive to melody in both music and language.

Moreover, if kites and falcons have learned to manipulate fire to flush out prey, this would be the first known use of fire as a tool by any nonhuman animal, overturning some old entrenched assumptions—the orthodoxy that only humans spread fire, and that our singular mastery of fire was largely what made us masters over the environment. But it could have worked the other way around, says Bonta. “It could very well have been the case that humans, birds, and fire coevolved in some sort of mutualistic relationship—perhaps humans actually derived the idea of using fire from watching birds. This is what plenty of myths about fire-spreading among indigenous peoples in Australia and elsewhere in the world tell us, after all—birds were the original fire-starters.”

			 Not long ago, Gordon Burghardt, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, took on the problem of crafting a more positive definition of play and came up with a set of five criteria for recognizing play in any species. First, it’s behavior that’s not fully functional, although it may resemble behavior that’s useful in another context. For instance, a puppy thrashing a toy mimics a wolf’s takedown of prey, but the puppy doesn’t end up eating the toy (well, not usually, although my pitbull-lab mix has been known to). Play is exaggerated, awkward, and repetitive—like all those excessive flourishes in flight of the ravens on Santa Cruz Island—and often inappropriate. It’s also spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, and rewarding. It’s only initiated when an animal is adequately fed, healthy, and not under stress. In sum, says Burghardt, “Play is repeated, seemingly non-functional behavior different from more adaptive versions . . . and initiated when the animal is in a relaxed, unstimulating or low stress setting.” In other words, it’s a kind of behavioral frill—but far from a frivolous one."

What Meir and York learned through their experiments was that the geese have yet another superbird mechanism: a unique response to temperature. In their bodies, the temperature difference between their cold lungs and their warm muscles can increase the delivery of oxygen by twofold during sustained flapping flight at high altitudes. The geese also minimize their metabolic rate, reducing the amount of oxygen they need to fly.

Vanessa’s resulting smile was nearly a magic spell all on its own.
       Dora’s own wedding was small, but Lady Carroway insisted on hosting a brunch at Carroway House for her as well.

Dora thought it was the perfect sort of brunch.

In fact, it was much better in nearly every possible way—but she suspected that had much to do with her choice of husband.

I was the secret good guy on the bad-guy team, right, playing the Company’s hand, not really a member of the Inquisition. But for every Jew I smuggled out of the dungeons because his genetic code was unique and the Company wanted it passed on, I had to watch as twenty were burned. Hell, I helped burn them. Being able to play the sinister Spanish devil, a good meaty part, wasn’t much compensation.

There she met a friend of a friend who had connections with Dr. Zeus. She did a lot of wistful talking over her nonalcoholic Chardonnay; so did her money. One thing led to another, and within two weeks the New Life Chumash Nation had placed its order with the Company. As the Company had known it would.
 Bring the Chumash out of the past for us, they said. Give us back our traditions, our ancient ways. We want to dress up in Chumash robes. We want the total Chumash experience. Spare no expense.
 And with those magic words, Dr. Zeus got to work. From their labs they got out all this Chumash genetic material that they, uh, just happened to have. They brought out all the carefully propagated flora and fauna of the Chumash ecosystem from their botanical and zoological gardens. They brought from their records every possible detail of Chumash folkways and culture, and boy, they sure had a lot of material.
 The sacred ground was detoxified and bulldozed back into its original contours; it was replanted; it was restocked with animal life. Cleaning and restocking the adjacent ocean floor was harder, but, you know, they’d said to spare no expense, and who was the Company to argue? There was some outcry from historical preservationists when the picturesque old oil rigs off the coast were dismantled. Cash donations shut them up.

Not quite, sir. You did preach that sermon, when you was tied to the stake and the fire waited for you. Maybe you recollect? You impressed the good people of Rochester no end afore you burned, sir.

Went ashore with a landing party on an island, all hot to kill himself a Spaniard, and what he found there—
Edward lifted his head. “Document D,” he said in amazement.
Aye, I see you’ve guessed. He found something that didn’t ought to have been there in 1578. Drake made damn sure nobody talked, but he wrote it up in his logbook and gave it to Elizabeth’s ministers, with an eye to national security. They didn’t know what to make of it, so it sat in the classified Crown archives until 1852. You know who found it there, Commander Bell-Fairfax, don’t you? And you know what he done with it.
“The Santa Catalina Expedition,” said Edward.
“But—Catalina’s where Dr. Zeus has its laboratories,” said Alec.
Right you are. So you see, Nicholas? If you hadn’t preached that sermon, the Company might never have been
founded Not that an old sailor like me understands paradoxes in temporal physics, mind you, but that’s the way it looks from here. If our Edward was a pawn for Dr. Zeus, weren’t you the one as made the opening move in the game?
Nicholas sat staring. Edward gave a brief laugh.

Aye, sir, you might say so. And all of ’em biting their tails.

“Drink with me, brother. To a better world, and better men.”
“I will,” said Enna-aru, and took the cup and drank. He passed it back to Atrahasis, who paused a moment and then drank down what was left.
He set down the cup and felt the biomechanicals swarming from under his

 By noon the king was feverish. Atrahasis watched the flush grow in his cheeks, watched his eyes take on a certain glassiness as he studied the maps of the city canals and the grain warehouses.
By twilight the king was sweating and faint, and the blotches had begun to come up under his skin. Atrahasis led him to the couch of purple cushions, with soothing and solicitous words, and had sherbet fetched for him.
By midnight the king was raving, with brief periods of clarity wherein he struggled for understanding. Atrahasis sat beside him, wiping the sweat from his brow. The king’s guard crowded in the corridor, watched from the doorway.
“If he dies, we will kill you,” said their chief, in an almost conversational tone. The king jerked and shuddered at the sound; Atrahasis rose in fury, but by the time he had turned and approached the mortal, there was nothing in his face but meek sorrow.

“Yes, in good truth, we have.”
“Would you mind awfully if we switched to Latin for this?” he inquired in that tongue. “It’ll go quicker.”
“Fair enough,” I replied in the same language, and we conversed in Latin after that.
“What about the Finn MacCool stories? Any of those?”
“Well, we did get a couple of songs about him from an old man who stayed here last winter,” I told him, noting that my red ink had sat too long and giving it a shake to mix it. “I don’t think his memory was very reliable, though.”
“Ah! Well, I’ve got the complete cycle. Sounds like a good place to begin, wouldn’t you say?” He grinned and fished a horn plectrum from the pouch at his belt.
“Let’s hear it,” I replied, and poised my pen over the lovely white page. Dear God, how I’ve missed writing, just the physical act of moving the pen, making the ink flow!
He had hours and hours of material on the Fenians, tales I’d never heard
before as well as the two stories the old man had given us (and as I’d suspected, the poor creature had garbled them badly). I myself was born Christian, and since my parents were zealous converts, they’d always frowned on their children listening to the old pagan stories. I knew all about Patrick and Moses and Noah, but I could never hear about Cuchulainn or Deirdre until I became a monk. Ironic, isn’t it?
Lewis recounted the whole cycle to me, all about Finn growing up in the forest because evil King Goll had killed his father, so the boy was raised in secret by a pair of druid women, who conjured a wolf-spirit to be his protector. Spellbinding! Lewis was a good storyteller, too. He had a mobile, expressive face, elegant gestures, and a nice light baritone. My pen swept across the page.
We didn’t even take a break until I got a paralyzing fit of writer’s cramp, just after the part where Finn calls his father’s ghost from the Land of the Blessed, and the old chief gives him advice. I got up and walked back and forth in the narrow stone room, swinging my arms, while Lewis took the opportunity to pour himself a cup of watered mead from the pitcher we’d brought.
He sipped and held the cup out to the light. “My goodness, who’s your Beekeeper? That’s great!”

Aegeus let go of her hands and she drifted away from us, lifting the hem of her gown as she went, her slow dance resumed. She found her way to the wall and danced for the shadows a while, and then fell to running her fingertips over the stones, tracing their pattern under the pattern of light and shadow.
“These aren’t human children, are they?” I stated.
“Oddly enough, they are,” Aegeus told me, watching Maeve. “Rather more human than you or I, my young friend, given what we are. Not a kind of human one sees often, however, in spite of the fact that they’ve always existed. Certainly not Homo sapiens sapiens. These creatures are on the order of hybrids, actually.

“We made it our business to find out pretty damned quickly, as you can imagine. It seemed the holy monks weren’t the only mortals who had a community at Malinmhor!

“I would never do such a thing, my lord,” the servant assured him. “I was trained in library science.”

I don’t know if Maeve cared. She basked for a while in the glory of having produced a daughter, and really a very pretty one. I saw the little girl when they were parading her around. She was not so pale as her mother. Her skin was like rose petals and her hair like white gold, but she had the same great wide eyes and delicate face.
Yet Maeve, it seems, grew jealous of all the attention paid to her daughter. They caught her pinching the baby when she thought she was alone with it. The infant was taken away, to be raised by Lady Maire, and Maeve found herself in real disgrace for the first time in her life.
Lord Aegeus had no time for her now. All his attentions were focused on little Amelie, the daughter. It was decided that Maeve had performed her duties admirably, and would henceforth be allowed to rest. They allotted her a single room adjacent to the infirmary. She would be given no new husbands, as her health had begun to suffer from constant breeding.
So I asked if I might have her back.

The lords and ladies bestowed her on me gladly enough, commending me for my sense of responsibility, but warned me that marital relations were best not resumed. They didn’t need to say so much.

But I couldn’t leave her indoors by herself, so I swathed her in a hooded cloak and carried her about with me, and set her in the shade as I worked.
She talked constantly. Mostly it was bitter complaints about the way no one ever brought her presents any more, and how unfair life was. Sometimes she would wander in her mind, and hold long conversations with Fallon. I don’t think she recognized me even when her mind was clear. I wasn’t angry about this.

“Five, sir,” said Latif coolly, putting down the vase and bowing. “I recently read your dissertation on Manasse ben Israel, and may I say how impressed I was with your insights into the influences at work during his formative years?”

The mortal with his trunk came after that, so I helped Latif get it up to his room. He insisted on squaring everything away before we went back downstairs, and I had to hide a smile at how finicky-neat he was, all his clothes pressed just so and severely grown-up in their cut. He even had a miniature grooming kit in a leather case! Silver-backed brushes and all; he only lacked a razor. Small wonder he looked askance at the toys I’d set out on his bed.
“Sorry about those,” I told him. “I wasn’t expecting somebody quite so, um, mature.”
“It was a charming thought,” he said courteously, giving one of his hats a last brush before setting it on a shelf. “And, after all, it does go with the character I’m portraying. I suppose I’ll need to observe mortal children to see how they behave, won’t I? Certainly all the rest of you seem to be doing a splendid job blending in with the mortal populace.”

Labienus sighs. So much potential in a bright child, if trained properly. All that splendid ability, wasted on one martyrdom to prop up some distant causal link to Dr. Zeus Incorporated …
Here is a statistic to make his heart bleed over might-have-beens: out of the four hundred seventeen mortals who heard Nicholas preach as he was being burned at the stake, fully twenty-two had heeded his plea to become martyrs to the Protestant cause themselves. Two hundred twelve had gone on to lose their lives in less immediate ways, in the defense of English liberty. Eighty-six more had gone into various levels of what passed for the secret service at that time, working for the downfall of Spain with patient fanaticism under Sir Francis Walsingham. Fifty-one had simply committed suicide, in varying ways, over the three-year period following April 1, 1555.
The point was, of course, that Nicholas Harpole had asked them to die, and they had. Or at least given up their lives. A miserable three hundred seventy-one mortals, when he might have laid waste to nations.
Much better success on the second try. Labienus smiles, coming to the pages added later, the reports from other operatives. He hadn’t minded when the Adonai project had been taken from him.

“How am I different?”

He looked up at me, knitting his brows again. “Well, you just are. You move different. You smell different. You talk like one of those people on the Wire. You and Michel, too. You know what I mean! Don’t you know?”

So the child would be able to catch a ball, as clumsy schoolboy Geert had never been. Able, moreover, to distinguish a cyborg from a mortal human.

“Why would you think that, Hendrick?” I asked him, crouching to offer him a tissue. He looked at me with an expression of weary patience.
“Be-cause,” he told me. “Don’t you know what’s been going on? All those people who are mad at Mommy and Daddy? They’re scared of me. They threw things at our windows. Mommy and Daddy want me to be alive but a lot more people want me to not be alive. It would be real easy to kill me. All somebody has to do is shoot through those windows with a gun. When I go to that school it would be even more easy. They could just shoot me in the street. They could shoot me in the car. Even if I wore a soldier helmet they could get me. So it’s all locked up.

A loose cannon. A compromise. An unacceptable exception to the rules. What had Aegeus been planning? Some kind of parity with the old project Adonai? Take an extraordinary child, gift him with extraordinary resources, and put him in a position to affect world events to the Company’s advantage?
If so, Aegeus had been successful. The really awful part was that it had been a public success.

Given unlimited attention from the moment of his birth, an only child who had but to point at something and, if money could buy it, it was his. Where was the shaping discipline? Where was the inner pain to spur him on to great deeds? He should have been profitless to the Company, a crashing failure for
Aegeus. At the very least, he should have become an empty-souled Charles Foster Kane.

“No, no; we hate you because you sell olive oil at lower prices than we do,” Labienus explained. “But if everyone believes you kill children, we can run you out of business and even the populares can’t complain.”
“You must understand, these are babies who have already died!” the priest insisted, horrified. “Miscarriages. Stillbirths. All who die of sickness or mischance.

“He takes them through the fire. That would be in the great bronze idol, the one with the head of a bull?”

Labienus withdrew a pair of gauntlets from a pouch at his belt. He put

He was a lanky fellow, quite tall but built solidly. He wore pajamas violently patterned with palm trees and vahines, not at all the kind of thing you’d expect a hunted man to wear. He had a long broken nose, and high broad cheekbones. When he rolled over, he exposed something strange twining up the back of his neck. It looked like a silver tattoo, in a pattern of vaguely Celtic-knot complexity.
It was not a tattoo, however. It was a subcutaneous wire hooking Alec up to the artificial intelligence sailing his ship, for Alec was a cyborg. Not at all some human-machine hybrid with a whirring ocular implant and a toneless voice, oh dear no; that sort of fashion went out generations before Alec was born. In any case, being a peer, he could afford the most elegantly understated cybernetic implants.
So much for what the hypothetical human observer would notice.
It would be rather more likely that a surveillance drone would see all this, zooming in across such distance, noting such detail. And a surveillance drone, having the ability to tune in to the ship’s system, its cameras and indeed to Alec’s own cyborged brain, would see a great deal more.
It would see, for example, two other men lying in the bed, at extreme arm’s length from Alec on either side, who appeared to be his nearly identical brothers.
The virtual man who slept, or tried to sleep, on the left, looked slightly older than the other two. He lay stretched on his side, one hand under his pillow as though groping after something he’d hidden there. He wore only ivory-colored drawers of an antiquated design. His name was, or had been, Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.
The virtual man on the right was not asleep at all. He lay on his back like an effigy on a tomb, clad in a flowing white shirt of even more antique design, his arms crossed on his chest. He gazed with an expression of despair on the gimbal lamp, which rocked gently as the ship crested each rolling swell, and which had dimmed itself to the comforting glow of a nursery light. He wasn’t comforted. His lips moved for a while in silent prayer. Tears welled in his eyes.
He could hardly be blamed. He found his present situation bizarre and intolerable, as you might if you, too, were Nicholas Harpole, burned as a heretic in 1555 but now inexplicably alive and drifting in a twenty-fourth-century ship, with a pair of your clones.

Instantly awake, the virtual man on the left rolled over and sat bolt upright, taking aim with the very real pistol he’d fetched from under his pillow. Its muzzle was a bare two inches from the face of Nicholas on the right, who recoiled from it. Alec, between them, opened startled eyes but lay motionless, staring at the pistol in confusion.
Any hypothetical human viewer would be confused, too. Without a way to tap into Alec’s brain, he or she would have seen only the man in the bed’s center sitting up, pointing a gun at empty space to his right. And the cold glare and military bearing of the man were not those of anyone who would ever wear vahine-patterned pajamas by choice. This was because virtual Edward had just seized control of Alec’s real body.
Edward! Belay that! said a gruff male voice, from a speaker concealed within a carving of a Spanish galleon. It was the voice of the artificial intelligence that ran the ship, and not—as one might be forgiven for supposing—a pirate hiding behind the panel.
Edward exhaled, shaking, but did not lift the pistol.
“Ghost or no ghost,” he said through his teeth, “if you start that damned praying again, I swear I shall kill you.”
“Do it, Homicide,” said Nicholas, “an thou darest!”
Edward regarded Nicholas, moving the pistol away only regretfully.

A word or two of explanation might be helpful at this point. Neither Edward nor Nicholas were ghosts, technically; but during their respective lifetimes each had carried in his brain, quite unknown to himself, a sort of black box. This device recorded in electromagnetic analogue every sensation, thought, and emotion experienced from the moment of its installation (immediately after birth) to the moment of death.
These recordings were made because neither Edward nor Nicholas were human, technically. They were Recombinants, as Alec was, and they had been made (very, very illegally) by an all-powerful cabal of scientists and investors known collectively as Dr. Zeus Incorporated, or more usually just the Company, which also possessed the secret of time travel, among other things.
For reasons that will not be gone into immediately but involved ensuring its own existence, the Company had needed a Recombinant. A prototype was designed, DNA engineered to produce it, and three test embryos cloned from one blastocyst. They were then scattered across time, implanted in human mothers by hard-working immortal Company operatives. Being, after all, test runs, the prototypes were not made immortal.
Nicholas and Edward, completely unaware of their destinies, nevertheless fulfilled them and died untimely if necessary deaths, whereupon the recorded sum of their lives went into their Company project files. Alec, however, had not died.
Like his—clones? brothers? other selves?—Alec had certain abilities completely unguessed-at by his shadowy creators. Unlike them, he was born into an era of advanced technology. When, as a child, he had been given a cybernetic companion, he had not only been able to modify it to suit his tastes, he removed the safeguard that prevented it from breaking any laws in the fulfillment of its primary directive, which was to protect and nurture him."

Captain Morgan (as Alec had named his companion) persuaded adolescent Alec to have himself modified with implants, so that he could exist simultaneously in three-dimensional space and in cyberspace with the Captain.
Being a sensible artificial intelligence, the Captain set about solving the mystery of Alec’s existence. Upon discovering that his fairly unhappy childhood could be laid directly at the door of Dr. Zeus Incorporated, Alec and the Captain embarked upon a campaign of revenge and exposure. Unaware they were being cleverly manipulated by the Company to accomplish its goals (I said it was all-powerful) they stole one of the Company’s time shuttles and had a number of adventures that ended more or less disastrously for Alec and a lot of other people, though not for the Company.
With its purpose for Alec fulfilled, the Company relaxed, confident in the expectation of his disposal when the time shuttle exploded, as it was scheduled to do. This failed to happen, however, because:
In the course of his adventures with the time shuttle, Alec blundered into a Company penal institution located deep in prehistory. There he encountered one of the Company’s cyborg slaves, the hapless Botanist Mendoza, an immortal marooned in the past for reasons which included her knowledge of the Company’s Recombinant project. She had discovered Project Adonai by sheerest chance, when she had the misfortune to encounter, fall in love with, and fail to prevent the untimely deaths of first Nicholas and then, three hundred years later, Edward.
She was, moreover, a Crome generator, the only immortal with a bizarre condition cursing its possessors with apparent psychic ability. Consequently her emotional health was not quite what was desired in an immortal, which was another reason she’d been confined to the agricultural station.
Upon meeting Alec, Mendoza slept with him, accepted his proposal of marriage, and passed on to him certain classified information to assist him in his goal of bringing down Dr. Zeus Incorporated. She also disconnected the explosive device on the shuttle that was intended to destroy Alec once his usefulness to the Company ended.
When, after several tragic accidents, Alec managed to equip his very large yacht with a time transcendence drive so he could go back to rescue Mendoza, he discovered that Dr. Zeus Incorporated had got there first. The unfortunate lady had been arrested again, and consigned to some even more obscure prison. Plundering Company files in his furious attempts to discover where she had been"

Most unwisely, he downloaded the whole thing, learning thereby the extremely unsavory truth about his own existence and, moreover, receiving the entire contents of both Nicholas’s and Edward’s black boxes.
Alec promptly had a nervous breakdown. Goodness, wouldn’t you, at this point? And, unable to assimilate Nicholas’s or Edward’s memories, Alec developed a disassociative personality disorder and gave them independent individual existences, complete with virtual physical bodies in cyberspace.
At least, that was the only rational explanation for what happened.
After attempting (and failing) to administer drugs to banish Alec’s unwelcome guests, the Captain decided to let them stay, since both Nicholas and Edward had strengths and skills that might prove useful to Alec.
Got it? All clear so far?
The Captain’s experiment was not proving an unqualified success, since the three Recombinant gentlemen discovered they couldn’t stand their own company, and struggled constantly for control of the one real body they shared. One thing upon which they did agree, however, was the urgent necessity of finding and rescuing Mendoza.
To this end, they hunted down their guilty creators and extracted at gunpoint the name of the prison where Mendoza was now confined: a site known only as Options Research.
Then they fled, away through time to an empty night ocean, where they were presently attempting to rest while the Captain devised a plan for Mendoza’s rescue."

This had become Nicholas Harpole’s habitual expression, and he was now solely in control of Alec’s body.

To be sure I have, lad. A tiny holoprojection cone emerged from the camera and seconds later a man appeared to stand beside the bed, big, black-bearded and villainous-looking, though his expression was kindly. Nicholas stared, fascinated even as he was repelled. He jumped when a hologram of a chair materialized behind the Captain, who sat down into it. “There now. Nothing to frighten thee.”
“I charge thee, Spirit, tell me! Dost thou serve the devil?” Nicholas demanded.
“No, sir, not I.”
“Dost thou serve God, then?”
“Well, no, sir, being what I am, which is to say no more than a device. I was made to serve Alec, sir, d’you see? Like a clock or a lute, to tell him the hour or cheer his heart. Or a dog, to guard him as he sleeps. Too low a creature to be damned or saved. Therefore, fear me not.”
“How canst thou speak with a man’s voice?” asked Nicholas.
The Captain waved his hand dismissively. “Why, sir, even a bird may be taught speech, mayn’t he, a raven or a parrot? Wherefore not then a clever mechanism? If a jack can be made to strike the hour in a clock, he may be made to speak, too; and such am I. Speak with me, then, and ease thy sick grief.”
Nicholas stared at him, marveling at the detail of the illusion: the movement of the Captain’s beard when he spoke, the creak of the insubstantial chair when he shifted his weight.
“But I am no more than thou art,” Nicholas said at last, bitterly. “A made thing, an alchemical homunculus. How shouldst thou comfort my soul, when neither thou nor I have souls, but only spirits? So might a clock comfort an astrolabe.”
“Ah, well, sir, I’ve no soul, to be sure; but it might help to talk, all the same.”
Nicholas lay back with a sigh, and gazed at the lamp.
“I have been disputing with myself,” he said, “since I have awakened into this unnatural life of horrible marvels, on the nature of Almighty God.”
“And how doth that make thee feel, lad?” inquired the Captain. Nicholas drew a deep breath and went on:

“I would a thousand pounds I might study Scripture again. Oh, that I had my books that were burnt!” Nicholas gripped the blanket with both hands.
“Then turn and look there, sir. See that text plaquette on yer night table? The thing what looks like green glass in a little window frame. Go ahead, pick it up. The other lads is both asleep, they won’t hinder thee. That’s a book, sir, of the kind we use in this day and age. My boy hath it to look at figures, but it hath a million texts in it beside. I’ll just open it for thee.”
Nicholas caught his breath. The dark glass lit up and bright letters appeared, informing him that he beheld THE OLD TESTAMENT, diligently corrected and compared with the Hebrew, by William Tyndale and finished in the year of Our Lord God A. 1536, in the month of September at Vilvorde.
He was struck speechless.
“D’you like that, eh? Look, when thine eye comes to the bottom of the page, the book knows and goes on to the next one for thee. Nor needst thou a candle, for the book maketh its own light. Be’n’t it a wonder, lad?”

He had willingly submitted to entering the metal box. Of course, he might have changed his mind since. Far too much time had passed for his fate to be altered now, however, even if he had been able to tell Marco.
Marco busied himself with arranging the table just as he wanted for what he had planned. He set out instruments, jars of chemicals; lifted Grigorii Efimovitch out to sprawl, trailing, on the steel surface. He pulled on a black rubberized raincoat, or something that looked a lot like one, and carefully worked transparent gloves on over his massive hands. He stepped out into the fast-fallen darkness and got himself another beer.
He drank, belched gently, and selected an instrument from the table. Grigorii Efimovitch had begun to twitch uncontrollably. Marco waved the beer at him in a consoling gesture.
“Well, you never know. We just might do it, Grigorii Efimovitch. Wouldn’t that be great?”
Grigorii Efimovitch’s eyelids fluttered. If this was an attempt to communicate it was lost on Marco, who breathed deeply and stood straight, setting down the beer. A gleam came into his eyes, a sparkling and terrifying joy.

It was rumored to have been transplanted, brick by brick, from some English village, back in the twentieth century when wealthy men still did things like that. It was named for the ship in which Sir Francis Drake had set out when he’d sailed off to loot the Spanish Main.
It had once been a very expensive bed-and-breakfast hotel, bar, and five-star restaurant. Various wars, political secessions, and natural disasters had altered its fortunes. Over three centuries it had been successively a triage hospital, a barricaded freeholding, a farmhouse, a partial ruin, and other things. But, situated as it was at a crossroads in a picturesque cove, as soon as civilization had reasserted itself enough to provide some traffic, the Pelican had evolved back into an inn.
Even a reasonably prosperous one, in this year of 2317. Plenty of trade from the local farmers and fishermen. Plenty of real money from the rich people who moored their pleasure boats in Muir Harbor, eager to get away from the General Prohibition in San Francisco.
Not that there was anything all that immoral to be had at the Pelican, of course, beyond homemade ciders and ales and fish dinners. Mavis paid a fortune in bribes to local law enforcement to be able to serve even those; but the people from the big boats wanted the thrill of the forbidden, and spent hugely for it.
Sometimes Mavis paid the local law enforcement to dress as picturesque smugglers, too, and they would lounge in her bar and leer pleasantly at the guests, or tell stories about desperate chases over the hills with kegs of mead. The guests would buy them drinks and would usually stay over an extra night. The local economy thrived to no end.

“Jeepers. What is this, the Migraine Channel? Gimme a leg up.”
The bartender hoisted him obligingly, and he sat on the counter and groped in his coat pocket for the case of tools he carried. It’s useful being a cyborg, even a rogue one, when you have to realign a holoemitter. Mortals think you’re an itinerant electronics genius, and so it’s all right that you’re a faintly shabby little man who never seems to have much money.
Joseph didn’t really need the tools, but he made a great show of using them anyway, and presently the holo images resolved and sharpened into one image, brilliantly clear in the dark midair: Mars, with the glassy dome and radiating green lines of the Martian Agricultural Collective near its equator, as a solemn voice lauded the courage of the first settlers sponsored by Areco. There was a half-hearted cheer from the patrons in the dart alley.
Joseph shivered, thinking that today’s courageous settlers were tomorrow’s vicious terrorists. He didn’t feel like thinking about the Mars Two disaster right now, though; this was a happy occasion, and Mars Two had another thirty-five years of blissful ignorance of its fate. He leaped down and took a little bow, then turned to the bar expectantly.
“So, am I good or am I good?”
By way of answer the bartender thrust the big embossed glass mug into Joseph’s hand. He took it smugly, strutted away to the parlor, and found himself a dark corner with a view of the fire. There he settled in with his back to the wall, and tasted his cider. Dark and dry, strong stuff. From the bouquet, he judged it to be"

Darts plunking into the board. Somebody unused to real alcohol getting sick in Room Seven. Rush of cold air, smell of the sea and the green alder trees, somebody coming in—
Instantly Joseph was on his feet, peering around the corner into the hall. But it was okay: two more well-groomed people in yachting clothes, murmuring in delight at how quaint everything looked, on their way to the bar. He settled back into his seat and relaxed, drank more of his cider, watched the fire.
He recognized Mavis’s firm tread long before she came around the corner. He got to his feet, doing his best to look dignified and respectable for her, as he ought to look if he were the former executive consultant he always claimed to be. He knew she didn’t believe him, though in fact he’d been a consultant to a lot of people, including pharaohs, in his time; but that was okay. Their relationship wasn’t built on belief.
She hove into sight like a Spanish galleon, and looked him up and down.
“So it’s you again?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Joseph said, giving her his most ingratiating smile. “Just stopped by on my way up the coast. Going to a business conference in Seattle, you know. Oh, and I had a look at your holoscreen. Works fine now. Just needed a little realignment.”
“Really? How nice. As long as you’re here, you might look at a couple of other things that need realigning,” she told him quietly, slipping a key into his hand. “And take a shower first. I’ll have some supper sent up.”
Sometimes it’s just great to be a Rogue Cyborg. Not only can Rogue Cyborgs fix holoscreens, there are a whole bunch of other useful things they can do better than mortals.

“Okay, Deadward, why’s it the third age of technology? What’s that mean?”
“I shall ignore your infantile humor and will be happy to explain, since you’ve inquired,” said Edward condescendingly. “I have formulated a theory of cycles of development in the history of mankind. They repeat in ever-expanding patterns, producing ages of Technology, Faith, and Reason.”
“Oh, that’s crap.”
“No, it isn’t. Technology was the first age, when primordial Man crawled from his dark shelter and discovered that by the simple expedient of striking flints in various ways he could provide himself with both fire and weapons,” Edward said. “Will you grant me that?”
“Okay,” said Alec grudgingly. “And?”
“And so the brute beast found himself, as it were, master of his universe. He had, of course, no idea of any consequences. He simply forged ahead, lighting fires and making spears, as fast as his clumsy hands could go. The result was, potentially, a greater lifespan for Man, but new and terrible responsibilities which he utterly ignored,” said Edward.
“Nowadays you’re supposed to say Humanity, you know. There were women back then, too,” Alec told him.
“Allow me my metaphor, if you please,” snapped Edward. “To continue: over the ages, the consequences of Technology did begin to make themselves evident to primitive Man. Fires, and bloodier warfare, prompted fear in his dim mind. With so much death in evidence, it was impossible not to wonder about his own inevitable demise. This prompted shamans to caper about and pretend their ancestors were giving them advice on the problem, and so was born the First Age of Faith.”
“And everybody went to Hell?” said Alec. Nicholas snorted.
“Not at all. Religion’s quite useful, at a certain level. It provides a notion of moral behavior and, as such, is the origin of ethics,” said Edward, steepling his fingers. “It is, at least, a system of thought, if it doesn’t degrade into mysticism. It got Man’s attention away from how he might more effectively spear his neighbor long enough to allow Civilization to begin.”

“I say nothing of the kind! It’s a tool, like the flint, and as such is nothing but potential. Whether it is used to good or evil effect depends on Man, the user,” said Edward seriously.
“Okay.” Alec nodded. “I’ll agree with you on that.”
“I will not,” muttered Nicholas.
“Weren’t you reading? In any case, Order took form out of Chaos, and pure rational thought, Man’s highest achievement, leapt into existence!” said Edward with relish. “It attained its fullest expression amongst the classical Greeks, but the Romans applied it with the greatest effectiveness. Systematically and logically they spread Civilization throughout the known world, to a degree that was not equaled for a thousand years.”
“The Romans were vile and depraved,” said Nicholas, setting the text plaquette aside.
“They became so,” Edward agreed. “They discarded the disciplines that had made them strong. With no moral code informing their lives, life became meaningless. This coincided with what one might call the Second Age of Technology. The superior engineering skills, the advances in metallurgy, all the tremendous and brilliant machine of their empire roared along with no purpose other than serving the appetite of its creators, who had no thought for the inescapable consequences any more than brute Man with his flints had.”
“Well?” said Alec. “So what happened?”
“The judgment of God came on Rome,” said Nicholas.
“Absurd! Rome fell because of errors in its judgment,” Edward argued heatedly. “Without rational guidance the great machine destroyed itself, and so followed the Second Age of Faith.”
“The Dark Ages of Christianity, right?” said Alec. Nicholas turned to him with an expression of outrage and Edward snickered. “It’s true,” Alec insisted. “And it wasn’t just Christianity. Islam happened, too. All those people beheaded and burned at the stake over nothing, man.”
“Ay. Nothing,” Nicholas agreed sullenly. “Sacrifices offered up to a God of bestial cruelty. Yet even so, in that Dark Age, who but Christ’s disciples had thy precious Civilization in their keeping? Who but they, and the Jew, and the Moor with his Koran, made books and schools, lest that Aristotle become a mute ghost? It was Faith sustained knowledge.”

“Because they began the Renaissance, which led to the Enlightenment. The Second Age of Reason,” Edward crowed. “True science and clear thinking at last! An Empire with real moral purpose.”
“Oh, hark at the Crown of Creation,” jeered Nicholas. “I’ve seen the dust wherein thine Empire fell. Rags, shrouds and cobwebs! Love was no part of its design, but only profit, and its loveless heart went to ashes at last. And thou too art humbled in thy pride, and liest here a phantom like me, dead and forgotten.”
Edward considered him, tight-lipped. “That remains to be proven,” he said at last. “And if the great wheel brought my age to an end, it will turn again.”
“The Enlightenment didn’t stop,” said Alec. “It’s still going on. We got out into space, didn’t we? We’ve got more science than you ever had.”
“No; you have Technology,” said Edward, a little wearily. “Tremendous power, wielded unwisely. The rest of human knowledge has been jettisoned as unnecessary. You’re illiterate, you believe in nothing, your lives have no meaning, no moral compass, no point.”
“Maybe because we’ve learned something you haven’t,” said Alec in a cold voice. “You and your logical systems! You think you know everything. There’s nothing to know, man, except that our genes will do anything to copy themselves. What makes you imagine the world is a rational place?”
“Your world isn’t, to be sure,” Edward replied. “And unless I’m mistaken, the next Age of Faith is already looming on the horizon, in the person of the Ephesian Church. Serves you right, too.”
Alec shuddered.
“But if it’s all just this big wheel going around endlessly—then we’re right, believing in nothing,” he said. “There is no point.”
“Yes, there is,” said Edward and Nicholas together.
“There is Love,” said Nicholas.

They gave you a death wish, and you can’t master it; how sad. I, on the other hand, have moved beyond all that. Edward made an elegant gesture of dismissal.

Yes. If only you had the power to envision it, Alec! Eternal summer and eternal youth in which to enjoy eternal love. You might wander with our lady, hand in hand, down any empty beach in any age of the world, like two innocents in Paradise! And what harm could you do anyone, then? When we worked our evil, you and I, we did so out of grim resolution and duty. We believed we must sacrifice our own happiness to improve the lot of mankind. Edward shook his head sadly. He looked into Alec’s eyes and his voice was smooth, suave, infinitely persuasive.
If we’d followed our hearts and run away with the girl, all this misery might have been avoided. Ah, but now we have the chance! Break the pattern of your own death, as she so hoped you would. Think what she suffered for your sake!

Thank you. I thought so.
LEAVE ME ALONE! Alec had tears in his eyes. I killed three thousand people on Mars, man! What the shrack am I supposed to do now? Live happily ever after?
You ain’t going to do nobody no good by dying, son.
Trust me, Alec; there are better ways to atone for your crimes than throwing your life away, said Edward. I know from painful experience.

After what she’s been through, this is the least I can do for her. Especially if it’s the only way we can keep her safe.

Ay, Nicholas said. Since it is done for love’s sake. What other law is left?
Alec nodded slowly.
That’s my good Nick! Now that we’re all square, Alec, there’s things we need to consider. I can start you on the Pineal Tribrantine Three straight off. The place we’re stuck, I reckon, is that there crucible of prime DNA you were made from. I’ve already lifted the file for Adonai out of Dr. Zeus’s archives. I even got biomechanicals designed what’s better than the Company uses! Every one of ’em a molecular Philosopher’s Stone. But I need that DNA for a genetic template. Think of it like a treasure map, Alec, what’ll tell the little bastards where they got to go for the loot.
Then obviously the next step is to locate the crucible, said Edward, and take it. Would it be a silver tube like the one in Mendoza’s file?
Aye, sir, likely, or a bit bigger. You were a lot more valuable, being an experimental prototype, so they’d have made a bucket of it.

He read with interest the files the Company had kept before its experiments with Crome’s had been discontinued. Its conclusions were: that Crome’s radiation somehow caused an individual’s electromagnetic field to bleed over into the temporal field, which perhaps caused what appeared to be precognition or déjà vu in certain mortals. Also, telekinesis could perhaps be explained by Crome’s causing a disruption in the temporal field, freezing objects briefly in time while space (following its normal orbital trajectory) swung out from under them. This perhaps accounted for documented cases of solid objects appearing to leap off shelves or float through midair, or even rain down out of a cloudless sky.
It might also account for the ongoing phenomena with the garden, wherein plants shot from seed to maturity in a night. Mendoza seldom generated Crome’s on these occasions, but did seem to be able to produce the temporal distortion at will. Just how she did it remained a mystery.

“This place is already sold, I’m afraid,” the foreman said. “But Mr. Glidden’s building more. You could inquire at his offices, up on Maiden Lane.”
“Yes, I might at that.” Edward nodded.
“Do you suppose, if we were very careful, we might walk through this one?” Mendoza said. “Just to see what the others will be like?”

The only thing remarkable about him was his eyes, which had an unnervingly piercing stare. Altogether he looked like nothing so much as the lead singer for Jethro Tull.

Dr. Ansolabehere was of a most agreeable, not to say docile nature, as husbands went. He had appeared in the common room of the Goat and Compasses one night in 1660 with no belongings other than a small sea chest and the clothes on his back. After a meal, a warming glass of rum, and an hour’s charming conversation, he had somehow taken up the position in Miss Venables’s life that he had occupied, with few interruptions, ever since.
And really she could not, in any way, admit that she regretted the nuptial arrangement. In addition to his considerable proficiency in the arts of love, Dr. Ansolabehere was quiet and clean, and never attempted to exert control over the household although he was, as she discovered, an excellent financial advisor. He was a capable surgeon (which even the most genteel of taverns required now and then), did not drink to excess, and tolerated her occasional infidelities with the greatest amiability. Best of all, he had an absolutely reliable remedy for the Pox.
There were only two peculiarities about the man: his obstinate refusal to market the remedy, which Mrs. Ansolabehere found most vexing, for it might have earned them more than six sugar plantations if sold freely in Port Royal; and his sea chest.
The sea chest was quite small, quite heavy, and never opened. Indeed, as far as Mrs. Ansolabehere knew its lock had no key. This need not present any difficulty for a determined woman with the proper hairpin, but Dr. Ansolabehere seldom let it out of his sight. Moreover, he had informed her that its contents were private;"

However, he had made one curious request. If at any time during his temporary absence from the house the sea chest should begin to whistle, she was to let him know immediately, regardless of where he might be or what he might be doing. So firmly had he insisted upon this, and with such an unpleasant and unaccustomed light of adamance in his black eyes, that Mrs. Ansolabehere had been quite unsettled for some hours afterward.
Judge, then, with what vexation Mrs. Ansolabehere received the news from Caroline, her maid, that there was an odd sound coming from Dr. Ansolabehere’s room; especially since this news was conveyed whilst Mrs. Ansolabehere was greeting none other than the Lieutenant Governor himself, Captain Sir Henry Morgan, who had arrived with a party of friends and was intent on aggravating his dropsy with a few hours’determined application of Mrs. Ansolabehere’s best rum.
“What?” she hissed over her shoulder at Caroline.
“It be squealing, ma’am,” repeated Caroline.
“Why then, go—go poke under the bed with a broom, sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Away! My apologies, Sir Henry. Here is my best table, with a cool breeze from the door, and here is John to serve. Will you dine, too? For I assure you I have an excellent hotpot on the fire.”
“No damn’d soup,” growled Sir Henry, lifting his haggard face. “I’ve enough water in me as it is.” He did not resemble the dumpy self-satisfied fellow depicted in Exquemelin’s notorious Buccaneers of America (a careful examination of its illustrations will reveal that all the pirates in that lurid compendium seem to be drawn from one model) but rather the other attributed likeness, the shadowy three-quarter portrait of the dark saturnine man in red, smiling enigmatically as the Mona Lisa. “Rum, madam! And ginger biscuits if you’ve got ’em.”
“To be sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Sent hot to the table, sir, within the hour!”
She and Annie, the cook, were frantically getting a pan of ginger biscuits into the oven when Caroline reappeared in the doorway of the kitchen, clutching a broom.
“It be still squealing, ma’am,” she said, close to tears. “And it ain’t under the doctor’s bed, ma’am. It be the little chest what’s squealing, ma’am.”

Why, it had been Tiara’s own kin who had captured the slave at last, famous Uncle Zingo! Though he was dust now, poor old thing, but famous dust anyhow. And Uncle Ratlin himself had been the one to kill the slave, trying and trying with the different inventions until he’d made one that was deadly enough to do the job. Tiara didn’t understand the big words and concepts that the Memory gave her, about biomechanicals and electromagnetic pulses and disruption, but it had been a great day indeed for Uncle Ratlin when he’d finally killed the slave.
Ever since, Uncle Ratlin had gone more and more among the big people, about his business in broad daylight even, and brought home wonderful presents for Quean Barbie. There was a great plan that was going to make them all very happy one day, that would avenge the kin and bring about the ruin of the big people and their slaves forever, and it all hinged on Uncle Ratlin’s invention."

Really, he didn’t look very bad; much nicer than all those old bones. He would do, she decided, for pretend kin.
But what could you play with a thing that couldn’t talk back to you? Tiara thought about it and her little face brightened. She ran off to her own hiding place and returned in a moment, carrying the pink and green acrylic afghan and a beer bottle she had filled with spring water. Sitting down beside the dead slave, she pulled his head and shoulders into her lap and awkwardly wrapped him in the afghan; then she tilted the bottle to his lips, pretending to feed him, spilling water down his waxen face.
“Pretty little baby, pretty little baby,” Tiara crooned. “Drink your nice milk and go to sleep.”
She had, like all the rest of her race, the power of absolute concentration on what interested her at the moment, fixation to a degree that would baffle one of the big people. So intent on her game was she, it mattered nothing to her that the dead slave trembled abruptly, that his mouth opened and fastened on the neck of the bottle, that he proceeded to gulp down the water.
“Good little baby,” Tiara sang approvingly. “Such a good baby, he drinks it all gone. Isn’t he clever! Mummy’s very pleased with him.”
The slave lay still, gasping for breath. She lifted the bottle away and he moved his lips as though he were speaking, but Tiara couldn’t hear anything. “Oh, he’s parched, he’s parched and dry, he needs a whiskey to tell that story!” she sang. “Does he want a whiskey, then?”
The slave might have nodded, or it might have been a shiver. Tiara decided to play it for a nod and jumped up, running off to the spring for more water. She returned in triumph and settled back down, lifting his head and holding the bottle for him. “Drink, drink!” she chanted. “And grow up big and strong.”
He finished the water and sighed, and his head sagged back on her arm. His lips moved again and this time she heard him speak, distinctly, a whisper of thanks.
“He can talk to me,” she squealed in delight. “Talk to me more, slave!”

“Always,” Tiara said. Her tiny brows drew together in a frown. “Uncle Ratlin will be mad. You were supposed to be dead.”
“Oh, but—” How rapid the slave’s breathing became. “You don’t want him to be mad, do you? And if you tell him I’m still alive, he’ll want to kill me again. And if he does that, I won’t be able to talk to you. You see?”
Tiara saw. “It’s a secret,” she decided.
“Oh, yes, Princess Tiara, it’s our secret. Please?” The slave’s voice shook. “You won’t tell anyone I’m alive in here, and I can talk to you, and play all the games you like.”
“But you’re broken,” Tiara pointed out.
“Well, that’s true, but I might get better. I’m sure I would, if I had enough time,” the slave argued earnestly. “I couldn’t even talk or think before, and then you gave me water to drink, and just listen to me now! I’m talking and thinking like mad.”
“I’ll get you more water,” Tiara announced.
She got up and ran from the room, not noticing his cries of: “Wait! Little girl! Princess! Oh, please, for gods’ sake, don’t leave me!” When she came back after refilling the bottle, he turned his face at once as he heard her come in. “Princess Tiara?” he called desperately.
“Don’t cry, little baby,” she said, putting the bottle to his mouth. He gasped and drank again, so quickly some of the water spilled and ran down like his tears.
“Thank you, sweet little princess,” he gasped.
“I like that.” She smiled. “Tell me I’m a sweet little princess again.”
“Oh, you are! You’re the dearest, sweetest little princess there’s ever been.”
“Tell me you love me.”
“I love you!”
“And I love you,” she emoted, clasping her hands together and tossing her head back. “You are my perfect treasure, and I die for wanting you!”
The slave’s mouth worked oddly. “My dearest love, you must never die,” he cried. “Surely if you die the stars will all go out!”

Dutifully Tiara leaned over and looked, though she knew perfectly well. “Yes,” she sang. “Ten fingers and ten toes, why, he’s perfect!”
“Both my feet are still there, then? And my arms and hands?”
“Yes, my treasure.”
“Apollo be thanked. Am I cut, my dearest? Have I wounds anywhere?”
“My poor brave hero.” Tiara pretended to weep. “They have murdered you entirely, there is blood in your beautiful golden hair.”
“Is there?” The slave blinked, frowning. “Yes. I remember that. He tried to open my skull. So there’s a wound in my head, my love?”
“Uh-huh.”
“Ha. Well, don’t trouble your heart, my darling.” The slave ran his tongue over his lips. “If you’ll look after me—if you’ll bring me water and food—my body will have what it needs to begin repairing itself. I don’t know how badly I’m damaged, but if I can regain some function—any function—” The slave began to tremble, and calmed himself. “Why, what a grand time we’ll have. And I can tell you stories—do you like stories, Princess Tiara?”
“Oh, yes,” she assured him.
“Well then! Do you know, I was a Literature Preservation Specialist—” The slave’s voice broke. He swallowed hard and went on, “And what that means is, I know every story in the wide world. I will be your own storyteller, princess dear, and nobody else will have such fine stories told. Only to you will I tell them. Will you like that?”
“More than anything, my prince,” said Tiara and sighed. Then, in a completely sensible voice, she added, “Except you aren’t really a prince. You’re just my slave.”
“Ah! Yes, but only your slave,” he insisted. “I would be slave to none but the beautiful Princess Tiara. I’m afraid if you tell anybody I’m here, they’ll come take me away from you.”

For a long while there was Cinderella and Puss in Boots and Hickory Dickory Dock, intoned in his weary patient voice from the moment Tiara yawned and sat up until the moment she’d yawn and snuggle down beside him.

From the world outside there were berries, and hazelnuts, and bird eggs. There were snails. The slave had shuddered at these, at first, and then made a game that they were escargot with garlic butter in white wine sauce. Sometimes Tiara would creep down to the farm and take anything that appealed to her from the big man’s kitchen, and sometimes things from his yard. Once there were towels left out to dry on the line overnight, and Tiara carried them away gleefully; for as her slave began to get better he could feel the cold, and she liked to wrap warm things about his shivering body, or wad them between him and the stony floor.
As Tiara got older and more skillful she learned to milk the big beasts into a jar, and would carry it back to her slave with scarcely a drop spilled. Then they’d feast on the cream, and with his throat refreshed the slave could go on with the astonishing stories, about Jason and the Argonauts, about Odysseus, about Rama and Sita.

Quean Barbie, up in her warm chamber with her captive suitors and her silent attendants, watched game shows and soap operas and Elvis holoes. Down in the dark, Princess Tiara drank of a different brew, began to grow into another kind of Quean entirely.
Her tastes did form around romances, as she grew. Every tale of chivalry and passion the slave had ever sung when he’d been a troubadour, she loved: Tristan and Isolde, Arthur and Guinevere, Pelleas and Melisande. Every jongleur ditty about Robin and Marian. All the Shakespeare love plays, acted out in the slave’s beautiful voice and with the gestures of his one good hand. Heathcliff and Cathy, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester enchanted Tiara. When he recited Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman for her, she wanted it every night after that for years.
Princess Tiara grew small high breasts, and began to develop a certain interest in the slave’s anatomy. No use; he couldn’t make those parts work, damaged as he was, and he explained that it wasn’t good for a little girl to start that sort of play too early anyway. Carefully, phrasing with exquisite tact, he made a request. She agreed, and the next night she went down to the farmhouse and rummaged around in the big man’s bedroom as he slept.

He did look so funny, with the big baggy trousers rolled up on his thin legs!

Thought he’d killed him. Careful, careful now.
“I am not interested in your kind offer, sir,” she told Uncle Ratlin, though the Memory was telling her this was the life she was meant for, this was the life that offered everything she could possibly desire for herself, lovers and status and presents!
“Ah, now.” Uncle Ratlin looked at her anxiously. “You don’t really mean that. I know what it is. You’re scared of the old bitch. Sweetie, precious babe, she’s old. And think of the kin. If you don’t come back, honey love, what’ll we all do? No new stupids to make things, no new Uncles to plot for us!

His gesture of affection is not meant for her, though he’s quite fond of Mendoza, in his way; Artificial Intelligences are just as capable of devotion as human beings are. She’s a well-behaved and obedient cyborg, but what really matters is that she loves his boy. Somewhere behind her brow, in a locked file, his boy’s consciousness is trapped. So is that of a similarly disembodied gentleman named Nicholas Harpole. Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax shut them both in there, and only Edward knows the code to release them.
The Captain has taken care of Alec since Alec was five years old. He’s not quite sure what the other two entities are. They were once living men, earlier versions of Alec produced by the same Company responsible for creating him from recombinant DNA. When they had served the Company’s purpose and been killed, an electromagnetic recording of their personalities—memories, emotions, skills—had gone into storage in their files and remained there, inactive, until Alec accidentally downloaded them into his own brain while fleeing from the Company into the deep past.
The result was a remarkable case of multiple-personality disorder for Alec and a continuing logistical nightmare for the Captain. The only thing on which the three gentlemen wholeheartedly agreed was the fact that they loved Mendoza, who had known each of them in their successive incarnations.
Nicholas Harpole, who lived in the sixteenth century and was a scholar and heretic, managed to adjust somehow to massive culture shock and loss of the foundation on which his religious beliefs stood; but then he was an extraordinary man.
So was Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.
Edward lived in the nineteenth century and was a political agent for the British Empire. He absorbed all the virtues and most of the vices of that massive institution, along with the cold-blooded practicality that enabled him to do his very unpleasant job. He died heroically in the service of the Gentlemen’s Speculative Society, an earlier version of Dr. Zeus Incorporated. His subsequent discovery that they lied to him most of his brief life has not been received well and, unfortunately for his creators, Edward has read Frankenstein.
He doesn’t think much of his other selves, either.
He dismisses Nicholas as a medieval zealot, limited by ignorance and religious superstition. Cybergenius Alec is in his opinion a dunce, the inevitable product of a soft and degenerate age, and worse: for Alec had been naïve enough to smuggle weapons to a particularly foolhardy group of rebels, and the result had been the destruction of an entire colony on Mars. Hence Alec’s flight, with technology he’d stolen from Dr. Zeus, into the past.
Edward’s perception of these other selves has decided him that he alone is fit to inhabit Alec’s body. His effort to achieve this state of independence has been partly responsible for the accident that brought him, maimed and broken, to the regeneration tank, and Mendoza to her present state of impairment, and Alec and Nicholas to … well, to the place they now inhabit.
But even if the accident had not occurred, Edward’s efforts to kill Alec should have been in vain. Edward is, after all, only a recording, nothing more than a program Alec himself is running, in disassociation response to the psychic trauma of having two additional lifetimes thrust into his memory. Or is he? Why can’t Edward be shut off?
And what exactly has happened to Alec and Nicholas?"

It appears that the truth about Time is rather more complex than we were told in school. Dr. Zeus explained to its little cyborgs that mortals perceive time in a linear way, because they have no other frame of reference; but in reality (they said) it is more of a spiral than a line, and when you learn to step across from one part of the spiral to another, you can travel through time. It would seem, however, that the Company wasn’t telling the truth. As usual.
Whoever first learned how to travel in time, whether it was the Company or those little pale people from whom it stole its technology—it appears they took one look at the awful incoherent vastness of it all, screamed, and hastily projected conduits of artificial linear time with which to travel through the mess in a more or less orderly way. The restriction against being able to travel forward in time was a result of the conduit system. Real time is nonlinear, chaos, all-simultaneous, extending through every direction and dimension at once, and Edward alone knows what this does to causality. Entropy is an artifact of mortal perception.

For nearly six centuries now it had clung to the black mountain above Cape San Martin, with varying degrees of success. Every so often it lost its grip, for one reason or another; either the winter storms would precipitate a slide or the San Andreas Fault would shrug, and greater or lesser portions of Garrapatta would plummet into the sea.
But its handful of citizens were a hardy lot, long accustomed to minor inconveniences like abrupt changes in elevation or rappelling down cliffs to purchase groceries. There were so many reasons to stay there! The breathtaking view of the Pacific, the grandeur and isolation of the coastline, the bubbling springs, the fresh air …
All the same, when the last bad El Niño had relocated the entire business district (five of the town’s eight public buildings had landed in a colony of elephant seals) there was reluctant talk of abandonment. The Protector had come to Garrapatta’s rescue, however.
Yes, Mr. Hearst had kindly evacuated the refugees and provided shelter for them down the coast at San Simeon while he brought in engineers, architects, and the most expensive antigravity technology. Over a period of five years the townsite was stabilized, the road restored, the businesses rebuilt. The citizens of Garrapatta now had every assurance that, regardless of how much the mountain moved in future, antigravity would keep their community exactly where it was. Any problems related to floating in midair could be solved with a few sturdy foot bridges.
The return of the natives was quite a gala event. They were loaded into Mr. Hearst’s own superyacht, provided with box lunches and taken up the coastline to the new boat landing he had built next to the former seal colony. There they disembarked and rode in the new antigravity elevator up to Garrapatta, where a brass band on the deck of the new general store played “Home, Sweet Home.” One of Mr. Hearst’s public relations people (he seldom appeared in public himself) then provided the townsfolk with a guided tour of the civic improvements.
Every least shack and vegetable patch had been faithfully restored, the general store was more spacious, the Vertical Café had lost none of its crusty charm, and the Garrapatta Springs Hotel had plumbing and new towels in case they ever had guests. Nor was this all: Mr. Hearst had even provided Garrapatta with a ninth structure, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Memorial Cultural Center.
This was a great improvement on the old Garrapatta Cultural Center, which had been housed in the hotel lobby and consisted of three holoes and a broken holoprojector. The new cultural center loomed grandly above the town, a building of reinforced concrete dug well into the mountain, with an ornate façade in Spanish Renaissance style. Within was stored a library of over a million entries in holo entertainment, games, music, and even literature, though the only one of Garrapatta’s citizens who could read was the cultural center’s new curator, Joseph X. Machina. Smiling and urbane, he shook hands with his new neighbors and hoped they’d all attend the Saturday night film fests he was planning.
The brass band went home, the public relations person went home, and life returned to what passed for normal in Garrapatta."

“This could work,” said Joseph in awe. “Won’t we need thongs, though? Where are we going to get water buffalo hide in this day and age?”

“Then that’s not what’ll happen,” said Telepop, “that’s just what you plan to happen.”
“And we’ll do a few other things,” Freestone went on hastily, sensing he’d put his foot wrong. “We close down all temporal operations permanently. And we retire all our cyborg personnel.”
There was a moment of silence wherein his last sentence registered, and then everyone turned to stare at the place in which Lopez usually stood during meetings. He was not there today, of course. This meeting had been called without his knowledge, and now it was becoming clear why.
“You’ve finally figured out a way to, er … shut down the cyborgs?” said Morrison.
“Yes, we have,” Freestone asserted. “The long nightmare is over! I’m sure you’ll understand if we don’t want to talk about it much, but it’s something we’ve been planning for years.”
“You’re certain it’ll work?” Roche wanted to know.
“Of course.” Freestone waved his hand. “We’ve had our very best people on it and I think we can assure you there’s nothing to worry about. One week from today, you might say the Company will be downsized.” He looked around to see if the old-fashioned word had confused anyone, but they seemed to have grasped his meaning. “After all, with temporal operations shut down we won’t need the operatives anymore.”
“But… won’t we lose a lot of revenue from the Day Six places?” asked Telepop.
“The cut in overhead costs when we retire the operatives will more than compensate us,” Freestone explained. “Just think: no maintenance expenses, no"

He had been preoccupied for days. His rooms were crowded now with stacked crates, and if a Public Health Monitor were to burst in for an inspection at that particular moment, Victor would have a great deal of explaining to do.
What was in all those stacked crates? Dangerous and immoral contraband, though once it would have been described as Christmas cheer or gourmet delicacies, garnered patiently from Third World sovereignties over a period of two years. There were bottles of old port, dark as blood, in those crates, there were bottles of the most costly champagnes. Liqueurs. Pate full of truffles, tiny containers of caviar. Obscure herbs and spices, wonderfully potent. Pickled oysters and the pickled eggs of wild birds, honey garnered from opium poppies, jars of clotted cream. If it was rich, if it was delicious, if it was bad for a mortal to consume, it was probably in those crates.
The immorality didn’t stop there. No, it went far beyond: for in a distant refrigeration locker, far above the sunny streets of Avalon, hung slaughtered and butchered animals, rotting on the hook to suitable tenderness for consumption. No Public Health Monitor could deal with this. He or she would be on his or her knees puking in the abattoir at the merest glance at all the bones and veins and muscles and slow-dripping nastiness … but to set aside the twenty-fourth century point of view for a moment, Victor had really bagged a lot of prime meat. Pheasants and grouse, a peacock, a wild boar, a sea turtle, a suckling pig and a calf, venison, and finally that ultimate martyr to humanity’s wickedness: a buffalo. Could anything be more deliciously perverse than to serve forth roasted buffalo to immortals who had spent the ages rescuing creatures from extinction?

Unresolved issues of anger, abandonment, or guilt—most particularly the latter—may confer an adult burden of emotion the young cyborg’s psyche is incapable of easily integrating.

And, of course, once His Godship had established that it was, in fact, laudable and proper that the boy should improve himself by the discipline of music, he went off to Vienna 1800 and came back with not only a mandolin but a violin, viola, cello, lute, and guitar, and set up a schedule by which Nicholas will master each in turn.
And, of course, Nicholas thought he could just pick up the mandolin and play it effortlessly, as he did when he was a mortal in 1555; and he couldn’t.

I saw another life, the one I might have lived in some other Spain, where a little girl never fell into the hands of dubious strangers or the Inquisition. Bright and detailed as film, the brief lifetime unspooled itself for my consideration: the girl grew up and made her way to England somehow, and became the wife of a somewhat less outspoken young vicar named Nicholas Harpole. Forty years of wedded bliss in a thatched cottage, Sabbath sermons, living perhaps long enough to see a Shakespeare play. Then sunlight in the green churchyard, and quiet dust…
We broke the surface and gasped for air, with shuddering pleasure. I heard the sea roaring. Edward tightened his grip and dove again, bearing me with him, and the roar grew louder. I saw white sails above a blue sea, brilliant sunlight.

Fifty years, perhaps, of respectability, thrifty life on an officer’s half-pay, a little stone house kept neat as a pin; then one monument carved with names and dates, loving husband, beloved wife.

Not these elegant folk uneasy, surely, not these gentlemen and ladies in evening dress. It was true that they were very nearly at the end of recorded time, but every one of them had seen epochs roll by, had survived horrors and splendors beyond mortal comprehension.
For example, Facilitator General Kiu—stepping lightly from the limousine, accepting Labienus’s proffered arm with a gracious smile—once clung desperately to the arm of the marauder bearing her on his horse from the flaming ruin of her village, in a world so long past the most determined archaeologist might seek for a trace of it in vain. She had seduced kings and ministers in her time, she had watched impassive as Troy fell. Nothing to frighten her in a little Armageddon."

Nothing had been able to terrify him since he had watched the other tribe confronting his parents’ timid little migrating party, challenging their right to cross a long-drowned causeway from one continent to an adjacent one. He had cried and cowered when the stone-tipped spears began to fly, hidden his face until the screaming stopped and he’d looked up into the pale eyes of the bearded giant. Why are you weeping, mortal child? his rescuer had said. This is the way of the world. He had built his immortal life on that wisdom.
So had Gamaliel, though he had heard it from a very different person: stern-eyed Facilitator Amaunet, leaning down like a living shadow through shattered clay-and-stick walls to lift him from his dying mother’s arms. This is the way of the world, Amaunet had advised him, and then she had added: Look at the slaughter, mortal child. This is mortal evil. Gamaliel had never forgotten, even to this late hour when he was adjusting his tie and nodding to her over the roof of their limousine.
And he had passed the wisdom on in his turn, when he had lifted the child who would be Aegeus from the smashed cart and showed him the whooping thieves playing ball with the head of the boy’s father. This is mortal evil, he had told the child. This is what the monkeys do. Never forget it.
Nor had Aegeus ever forgotten, though he had built walls of graciousness around himself to contain the ugly truth, kept it locked away as though in a reliquary of gold and rock crystal, meant to hold something precious. Indeed, the truth was precious, and he had carefully gifted young Moreham with it, when he had found the child shivering, trying to warm himself at the ashes where bones smoldered. Aegeus had taken him up and set him before him in the saddle, and pointed out across all that the legions had left of Isurium. Never forget this, he had instructed. Never forgive them.
There were indeed certain ideological differences among the immortals arriving for dinner. Certain heads were eagerly anticipating seeing certain other heads roll, so abiding was their mutual hatred. Yet all of them shared one common bond, in their profound loathing and contempt for mortal humanity. They had never forgotten. They would never forgive.

No more than three ever came around the same side of the table at any one time, however, so as they moved off to busy themselves with bringing in the fish course everyone relaxed.
Not so far that each dish wasn’t thoroughly scanned as it was set before them. But no trace of anything toxic was found; not in the poached salmon in mousseline sauce, nor the oysters, nor the braised sea turtle. Therefore, light and sparkling conversation accompanied the second course, with the appropriate white wines.
It was dinner conversation of the highest caliber, too, refined to an art at tables in old Byzantium, in Pompeii and Amarna and Angkor Wat, polished in every beautiful doomed place that had ever spread its cloth for a pale horseman.

Here and there distinct objects stand out from the main mass: a good-sized pumpkin where the head would be, and a jaunty pair of coconuts somewhere else. Glints of silver and wire, chips like fish scales, indicate the presence of electronic components incorporated into the body.
Being incorporated into the body. For, even as Nicholas and Mendoza stare, the pile is altering: shifting, condensing, settling, as though alive with tiny moving things—which, in fact, it is. The effect just misses being unspeakably horrible, by virtue of the fact that the body is not decomposing but taking form.
“I thought the pumpkin was a particularly nice touch,” says Edward, framing it with his hands. “Rather classical, don’t you think?”
“I just redesigned a few nanobots like I said, and let ‘em multiply, and eyedroppered ‘em on, and they went crazy,” says Alec proudly. “Look how fast it’s going.”
And indeed it is going quickly. Even as they stare, the pumpkin is shrinking in on itself, changing color. Its surface is beginning to pucker and morph into the semblance of a familiar face. Eyes form first. Mendoza accepts a sip of rum, watching the ongoing metamorphosis. “This is different,” she states, handing the bottle to Edward. “My gosh, is that a waistcoat forming? You’re making him with clothes already on?”
“Yup,” says Alec. “I thought it’d save time. Neat, yeah? Clothes and beard and everything.”

“Maybe the buttons undo at that.” The Captain’s eyes lit with wild surmise. He stood in the booth and, unbuttoning his coat, slipped it off cautiously.
“Ugh! Now, that’s a right creepy feeling.” He held the coat against the table, then against his drink. “I got sensation in the coat like it was skin, even when it ain’t on. It don’t like being off me. Still…” He tugged experimentally at the cufflink on his right sleeve and worked it loose. With great care he rolled his sleeve up, an inch at a time. “Bloody hell, this feels funny.

The white heat had flared into white flame. Nicholas raised his eyes to the gargantuan columns, the pulsing lights. Had Mendoza, and all the others like her, suffered over so many years for this thing? These were only symbols; and not of eternal truths but mere collected facts, and inaccurately recorded and outdated facts at that. So many receipts to millionaires for services rendered. The Temporal Concordance! The empty-eyed face smiled at him, as though they were the riches of the world.
“No,” said Nicholas. “I know whose child I am, and what I am. You are only a false god.” And his flame rose to engulf him, wrath so pure he was in ecstasy, though he had battled all his life to keep it in check. Here, at last, was the purpose for which it existed. He became a column of fire and light; and, in that place of symbols, his white rage was a blazing sword in his hand.
Nicholas attacked. In grim silence he shore away the arm of lightnings, the blind eyes, the loveless power, the cathedral of lies and half-truths, the guttering lamps of pomp and majesty. He brought it all down, did Nicholas; he destroyed a world.
When it lay in ruins about him, Nicholas lowered the sword and looked on what he had done. He could hear, distantly, the wailing of mortals, the lamentation of machines. His wrath sank down, died. He saw in memory Mendoza’s face, her black eyes sad as she downloaded a chapter on revolutions.
Here you go. Great heroes and the things they wrecked. Always easier to destroy something than to create something. It’s harder to plant a garden than to blow up a building, and undoubtedly more boring, but you just might need to do it one day, eh?

The woman came swiftly forward to stare at him. With a wordless cry of sorrow she sank down and took the slave’s head in her lap, stroking back his hair. He blinked, he tried to speak but couldn’t get a word out in his surprise.
“He’s hurt, my poor hero is hurt, my bad uncle shot him and spoiled his poor biomechanicals after he’d worked so hard to get them online again, but you’ll help him, I know you will,” Tiara prattled happily to the big man. “For who is so brave or so clever as you?”
The man turned his head, considering Tiara, arching one eyebrow. Then he looked back at her slave. Leaning down, he took the slave’s hand in his own and gripped it firmly. “A-ah!” cried the slave, as something seemed to flow down his arm from the man’s arm, and then he arched his back and gasped and shuddered. His skin flushed with color, his lungs filled with breath. The woman held him as his whole body convulsed, once and twice and a third time. He shut his eyes, opening them again after a long moment.
Tiara, leaning close, saw his pupils dilate and contract. The long years of his darkness ended, and Lewis looked up into the face of the very tall man.

The waves rolled and tumbled them ashore, and how heavy Tiara’s slave was as she struggled to help him from the water. Exhilarated as she was to be having an adventure at last, she was still weakened and half blinded by the blazing sun as it rose. She wept as she pulled her slave into the shade, onto a grassy lawn that sloped down to the beach.
“Don’t cry,” he told her. He groped for her trembling hand. “Don’t be afraid, child. Just let me rest a little. We’ll make another plan.”
“But we left your vitamins,” she sobbed. “And what if this is the Cyclopes’ island? Or there might be cannibals, or pirates.” She looked fearfully out at the big boat.
“I really don’t think—” he began, but was interrupted by her shrill cry. She had just turned around and looked into the interior of the island, and seen to her astonishment that the lawn where they lay was only the edge of a vast and beautifully tended garden. It was bright with flowers, it was shaded by trees heavy with fruit, and there were pergolas and balustraded stairs leading somewhere, but Tiara didn’t notice where, exactly; for standing not a stone’s throw away on the green lawn were a big man and a woman. They were staring at Tiara and her slave, in astonishment no less great than her own.
They walked forward. Tiara cringed above her slave to protect him, blinking desperately in the brightness, trying to see them clearly. “What is it?” The slave turned his head this way and that.
“Oh please,” Tiara whimpered. They kept coming, and she glanced sidelong at the woman and turned to peer at the man, but she had to crane her head back to look, he was so tall, he went up and up against the green trees—
Her mouth fell open, and then her little face was radiant with joy and relief. “Oh, it’s you,” she said. “Oh, we’re saved! You’ll save us, you can do anything.”

“Why should we obey you?” Budu asked.
“Because I’m, er, omnipotent,” said Alec.

He and Mendoza take tea on the terrace every epoch/evening, and wait for their—sons? Other selves? Other halves? Whatever the hell the relationship is—to come home from work. Just like any other family. Almost.
And speaking of families: it was agreed that no more immortals would be made, ever. No more stealing mortal children and putting them through years of surgery and programming. But when it was discovered that Edward and Mendoza had figured out a way to have babies … what a surprise! It turned out there were a lot of immortal women, and no few men for that matter, who had secretly longed for the chance to have kids of their own all these years.
I thought it was a really dumb idea, but despite my—choke—family relationship with the holy trinity, my opinion doesn’t carry a lot of weight. Edward feels that proper parenting skills are important, in fact indispensable to immortals, that if we’d had a chance to develop them there wouldn’t have been creeps like Labienus and Aegeus.
So anyone applying to Captain Morgan (how’d you like to have him for your OB-GYN?) gets advice, assistance with producing embryos from DNA and implantation, and—oh yeah—a great big autographed copy of Child Care in the Cyborg Family, all nine million volumes of it. Kids that come with a manual, no less. Latif and Sarai have had a child. Kalugin and Nan are having one, too.

Another important factor is diet: some foods thicken the seeds in the body, others in turn thin and diminish them. A third factor of great importance is the mode in which the pleasures of intercourse are enjoyed. It is thought that women conceive more readily in the manner of four-footed beasts in a prone posture with loins uplifted so as to give access to the seed. Certainly, wives have no need of lascivious movements. A woman makes conception more difficult by offering a mock resistance and accepting Venus with a wriggling body. She diverts the furrow from the straight course of the ploughshare and makes the seed fall wide of the plot. These tricks are employed by prostitutes for their own ends, so that they may not conceive too frequently and be laid up by pregnancy and at the same time may make intercourse more attractive to men. But obviously our wives can have no use for them."

If you find yourself thus passionately enamoured of an individual, you should keep well away from such images. Thrust from you anything that might feed your passion, and turn your mind elsewhere. Vent the seed of love upon other objects. By clinging to it you assure yourself the certainty of heart-sickness and pain. With nourishment the festering sore quickens and strengthens. Day by day the frenzy heightens and the grief deepens.

 The trick with Gadfly was persuading him to wear the same clothes for every session. Oil paint needs days to dry between layers, and he had trouble understanding I couldn’t just swap his entire outfit for another he liked better. He was astonishingly vain even by fair folk standards, which is like saying a pond is unusually wet, or a bear surprisingly hairy. All in all, it was a disarming quality for a creature who could murder me without rescheduling his tea.
 “I might have some silver embroidery done about the wrists,” he said. “What do you think? You could add that, couldn’t you?”
 “Of course.”
 “And if I chose a different cravat . . .”
 Inwardly, I rolled my eyes. Outwardly, my face ached with the polite smile I’d maintained for the past two and a half hours. Rudeness was not an affordable mistake. “I could alter your cravat, as long as it’s more or less the same size, but I’d need another session to finish it.”

I supposed it had something to do with vanity, and their insatiable thirst to surround themselves with human Craft. They would never reflect on their youth, because they knew nothing else, and by the time they died, if they even did, their portraits would be long rotted away to nothing.
 Gadfly appeared to be a man in his middle thirties. Like every example of his kind he was tall, slim, and beautiful. His eyes were the clear crystal blue of the sky after rain has washed away the summer heat, his complexion as pale and flawless as porcelain, and his hair the radiant silver-gold of dew illuminated by a sunrise. I know it sounds ridiculous, but fair folk require such comparisons. There’s simply no other way to describe them. Once, a Whimsical poet died of despair after finding himself unequal to the task of capturing a fair one’s beauty in simile. I think it more likely he died of arsenic poisoning, but so the story goes.
 You must keep in mind, of course, that all of this is only a glamour, not what they really look like underneath.
 Fair folk are talented dissemblers, but they can’t lie outright. Their glamour always has a flaw. Gadfly’s flaw was his fingers; they were far too long to be human and sometimes appeared oddly jointed. If someone looked at his hands too long he would lace them together or scurry them under a napkin like a pair of spiders to put them out of sight. He was the most personable fair one I knew, far more relaxed about manners than the rest of them, but staring was never a good idea—unless, like me, you had a good reason to.
 Finally, Gadfly ate the cake. I didn’t see him chew before he swallowed.

Anyway, bodies react in strange ways under stress. Adrenaline and all that, as you know. I figured that trauma could cause the body to chemically alter.” He began to speak faster. “But the problem is, trauma is such a vague word, right? It’s a whole blanket, really, and I needed to isolate a thread. Millions of people are traumatized daily. Emotionally, physically, what-have-you. If even a fraction of them became ExtraOrdinary, they would compose a measurable percentage of the human population. And if that were the case EOs would be more than a thing in quotation marks, more than a hypothesis; they’d be an actuality. I knew there had to be something more specific.” “A genre of trauma? Like car accidents?” asked Victor. “Yes, exactly, except there weren’t indicators of any common trauma. No obvious formula. No parameters. Not at first.” Eli let his words hang in the car. Victor turned the radio from low to off. Eli was practically bouncing in his seat. “But?” prompted Victor, cringing at his own obvious interest. “But I started digging,” said Eli, “and the few case studies I could dig up—unofficial ones, of course, and this shit was a pain to find—the people in them weren’t just traumatized, Vic. They died. I didn’t see it at first because nine times out of ten when a person doesn’t stay dead, it isn’t even recorded as an NDE. Hell, half the time people don’t realize they’ve had an NDE.” “NDE?” Eli glanced over at Victor. “Near death experience. What if an EO isn’t a product of just any trauma? What if their bodies are reacting to the greatest physical and psychological trauma possible? Death. Think about it, the kind of transformation we’re talking about wouldn’t be possible with a physiological reaction alone, or a psychological reaction alone. It would require a huge influx of adrenaline, of fear, awareness. We talk about the power of will, we talk about mind over matter, but it’s not one over the other, it’s both at once. The mind and the body both respond to imminent death, and in those cases where both are strong enough—and both would have to be strong, I’m talking about genetic predisposition and will to survive—I think you might have a recipe for an EO.” Victor’s mind whirred as he listened to Eli’s theory. He flexed his fingers against his pant legs. It made sense. It made sense and it was simple and elegant and Victor hated that, especially because he should have seen it first, should have been able to hypothesize. Adrenaline was his research topic. The only difference was that he’d been studying temporary flux, and Eli had gone so far as to suggest a permanent shift. Anger flared through him, but anger was unproductive so he twisted it into pragmatism while he searched for a flaw. “"

But he had Eli’s attention. He liked having his attention. “Who knows how many factors? But I’m willing to admit that the body is capable of incredible things in life-threatening situations. That’s what my thesis has been about, remember? And maybe you’re right. Maybe the body is even capable of a fundamental chemical shift.

What’s more—my last name is my mother’s pure invention, her attempt to get away from her own family, whose last name I have never known, but my father won the first-name argument in the end, and Charlotte Marie was made my legal name, though my mother still called me Cindy and both my brothers called me Malone, Mally, or Loner. Since there were too many Charlottes in my third-grade class, a teacher started calling me Marie and that stuck for a while and I didn’t mind. In college I was Charlotte again, by default of roll call, but some people in journalism school called me Lucca—as most of us had adopted the newsroom affectation of calling people by their surnames. When I began publishing I used C. M. Lucca, and though I’d only intended for “C. M.” to appear in print, most of my colleagues started calling me C. M. Henry had the bizarre habit of calling me Char, which wasn’t a name at all but something you do to a piece of dead flesh, but I accepted this name, too, for no reason other than I had no preferred alternative.

Of course, I always had my boys memorize photographs of the major critics and curators, but this was truly hilarious, I thought—how was this kid to know, by sight alone, whether someone was important? I can’t say why I even entertained the notion, but I went out to the gallery and there she was, wearing this loose silk dress that went to the floor, some kind of circular pattern, but it was the way she was looking at the work—with a complete viciousness. I don’t know how else to explain it, as if it would be dangerous for her to look at you.
 “Was she enjoying the paintings, I asked, and she said, ‘Oh, no, not at all.’ She didn’t even turn to see where the question had come from. I asked if she was a collector, or an artist herself, or…? But she didn’t answer, just paced around … Eventually, she asked if I was the one to blame for these paintings. I told her that I was indeed the gallerist here, and she turned to me for the first time and said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear that,’ then launched into this explanation about how terrible the work was, how the artist had no understanding of color or dimensionality or texture, that he was indulgent, that he had no ideas, that the paintings documented his every missed opportunity. She said—‘He didn’t put anything in the paintings because he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know anything about art, and worse, he doesn’t care.’ Now, of course I was accustomed to criticism—I even welcomed it on occasion—but no one’s opinion ever made me as doubtful as hers. Ah! Then she said this one thing I’ve thought of many times since—‘You have to know what you’re leaving out in order for it not to be there. Otherwise, it’s not an absence, it’s just nothing.’ And immediately I had a better understanding of all those void artists back then—there were so many of them. Anyway, I sent the desk boy home early, and eventually this woman said her name was Věra, and I asked her how it was she’d come to her opinions about art. ‘Oh, they’re not opinions,"

After buying an old truck, she spent a half hour speed-reading an auto mechanics textbook, and from then on she took care of all the truck’s maintenance. The few times I ever complimented or even commented upon the speed with which X could absorb a new skill, she insisted—not out of humility, but in frustration—that there was nothing to it.

In 2015, CNN saw its highest viewership in seven years and enjoyed the strongest rate of advertising growth of any cable news network. Journalists mocked the network’s Trumpist worship, often with good reason, but television economics is not a morality play. Trump and Zucker’s relationship proved to be fantastically profitable.
			 ESPN and CNN have discovered what Top 40 radio has known for several decades: Most people tune in to a broadcast to hear more of something they already know. Radio audiences can’t anticipate what the next song will be. But as every car driver and radio executive will affirm, people mostly just want to hear songs they recognize. For decades, DJs on pop music radio stations have considered unfamiliar songs to be “tune-outs” because audiences tend to spurn new music. These listeners want to be surprised—that’s why they play the radio rather than a CD or playlist—but they want to be surprised by the feeling of familiarity."

In both activities, one can mostly fail 70 percent of the time and still be an all-time great. But the difference between baseball and business is that baseball has what Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos cleverly called “a truncated outcome distribution.” Home runs can only be so big. In a letter to shareholders, he wrote:
			 When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

After that, Bulgrin said, things “started to change rather dramatically.” SportsCenter had become the thing every sports fan quietly craves: a news machine for delivering new takes on familiar stories. Ratings soared, and ESPN has been the favorite network of American men every year since.
			 In the last few years, CNN has taken the same approach, devoting more time to fewer stories, like terrorist attacks and disappearing airplanes. This makes for pretty repetitive TV, if you watch all day long. But who would want to watch CNN all day long? The typical television news viewer watches about five minutes of cable TV news per day. CNN is doing something smart—maximizing viewers’ expectations that they will see a story they recognize no matter when they tune in.

The second dimension is closer to vicarious goal fulfillment. It’s what people ask for in surveys—hard news on the News Feed, salad on the menu—but doesn’t always show up in their observed behavior. The third dimension is the most complex and, perhaps, the most valuable.

 If somehow you were able to get close to the Sistine Chapel ceiling, if you stood on a high scaffold as Michelangelo did and raised your chin, you could see exactly how much work the master got done in a day. Each morning, the artist and his assistants prepared an area that would need to be fully painted at day’s end, when the fresh application of plaster dried. The result would be a giornata—Italian for “day’s work”—and the ceiling is really a mosaic of these small, irregularly shaped accomplishments with barely perceptible borders. Adam, reclining, is four giornate. God, outstretching, another four.

 In Ibn ‘Arabi’s conception, humans have two distinct ways of seeing. First, we have a faculty of awareness at the heart of our hearts, a piece of our consciousness fine-tuned to perceive reality, an unmediated ability to apprehend the world’s beauty and sublimity such that the Real (or God) feels near and unconcealed. It is the type of seeing the mihrab inspires in me.
 But we also have our logical brains, and they remind us how little we’ve seen of the world and what small means we have of deciphering its ultimate reality (or manifold realities). Looking at the universe this way, its truth seems distant and hidden, and the Real feels incomprehensible. It is the type of seeing the “Simonetti” carpet inspires in me."

By choosing to erase certain lines and extend and repeat others outward over an infinite grid, they created innumerable patterns that were all derived from the original circle, which in its oneness was emblematic of God.

I was sitting alone in a dark Alamo Drafthouse theater, scribbling notes about a documentary called The Work. In the film, the cameras take you inside Folsom State Prison for intensive group therapy sessions. Men convicted of crimes sit side by side with visitors from the outside who haven’t been sentenced to jail but are dealing with buried issues that are inhibiting their lives. Over the course of four days, both the incarcerated people and the free men push one another to open up about their struggles. Many participants resist. Early on, several of the men judge, scoff, and pay lip service to the whole ordeal. But eventually the dam breaks for everyone. Some of the men go into a blind rage after particular comments from group members prick their suppressed pain. They punch and writhe. Their neck veins pop. One of the visitors, Brian, emits a guttural howl that sounds like the devil is flying out of his chest. But after these bouts of explosive anger and violence come tears. Some men nearly collapse in exhaustion, having finally let this suppressed pain out of their body. In Brian’s case, his face transforms after punching and screaming and crying. It’s an epic expulsion of emotion. It takes multiple incarcerated men to restrain him. When the outburst is over, Brian’s eyes are lighter. He literally looks like a different person.

			 “Yeah, that’s the one,” Nick said.
			 It was impossible to have grown up as a climber in Colorado and not have heard about Jim Collins. In 1979 he’d made the first ascent of a route named Genesis, at the time Colorado’s hardest pitch of free climbing. Rumor had it that he’d also free soloed the Naked Edge, a six-hundred-foot-tall prow that’s one of Eldorado Canyon’s most famous routes. Apparently he wasn’t proud of it, though—too much risk, as he subsequently reflected—so he kept it quiet. His real fame came later in life, as a business consultant and author. After a teaching stint at Stanford, he wrote several best-selling books. I admired not only Jim’s ascents, but his ability to create balance in life beyond climbing.

What about all those dreams I’d had of travel and not conforming to the usual expectations?
			 One evening around the dinner table I stared down at my hands, fumbling with how to begin.
			 My mom slid her hand across the table and took mine in hers, “You know you don’t have to go to college right now, right?”
			 I looked up at her. I hated the idea of worrying her, and in that moment I saw that she looked hopeful.
			 “Listen,” my dad began, “school will always be there for you when you really want it.”

			 “If you want,” my mom said, her eyes shining and her mouth twitching into a poorly hidden smirk, “you can ditch your dad and me for a year and hit the road.”
			 “You’d be on your own,” my dad said. His expression turned serious. “But there’ve got to be a few things we make clear.”
			 The few things were truly a small number. This was to be a reality check for me. I could raid the pantry to start out and whenever I came back through Estes. Other than that, no financial support. Though he didn’t say this, I sensed that my dad wanted me to experience the dirtbag life. I also think he thought that I might enjoy it. As usual, he was right. Funny thing was, I’d been wondering for a while if getting some space from him would help me find the direction I needed. My mom and he had been thinking along the same lines.
			 Within a day or two I replaced the passenger seat in my car with a piece of plywood for a bed and hit the road. Where to?
			 When in doubt, go with what you know.
			 I traveled from one sport climbing area to the next, checking off a few routes I hadn’t sent on previous trips. I continued attending competitions, usually placing in the top three, but almost never winning. After entry fees, the prize money typically left me with about a hundred bucks a month, enough to keep climbing and going to comps. I showered maybe twice a month at YMCAs, and spent my rest days at public libraries and dollar movie theaters. I shopped at dented can and expired food stores, and even did a bit of Dumpster diving.

It is “retro” because it reproduces itself in a way that’s backward from how most life-forms manage this wonderful trick. In the nucleus of each cell in our body, and we have an awful lot of them, the genetic recipe for building our entire body can be found. Every cell has the complete list of instructions. Those genes are packed in DNA, tightly coiled molecules of nucleic acids. To make use of all the instructions in our genes, certain enzymes unwind the DNA helix in the cell’s nucleus. But to ensure that the precious DNA is not lost, another enzyme swoops in and makes a copy of the DNA needed. This is called transcription. This copy is made literally backward and has a few special alterations. (One of these alterations is to a base called uracil, a molecule whose origin may be extraterrestrial—yes, really.) The copy is called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The RNA blueprint is then transported from the nucleus to a ribosome, which, once it gets its hands on the RNA, translates the backward code and makes proteins from the blueprint.
			 DNA  RNA  Protein 
			 Simple as one, two, three. For decades, this definition of the process, made by Francis Crick, the codiscoverer of DNA with James Watson, was considered scientific dogma. That is how life works. So imagine how surprising it was when scientists discovered that a virus could run in the opposite direction. Retroviruses forced scientists to question what defines life. Here was an organism with a genetic code of its own but with no cell to house it. Can you be alive if you hold the blueprint to life but have to borrow the construction plant from another organism? Can there be life outside a cell? Taxonomists have spent decades debating this, perhaps pointlessly. As Carl Zimmer argues in A Planet of Viruses, “Trying to find a moment in time when such RNA-life abruptly became ‘alive’ just distracts us from the gradual transition to life as we know it.”
			 This is what retroviruses do. They trick our cells into making the proteins they need, as directed from their RNA. Instead of starting with DNA, HIV holds all its genetic information as RNA. The virus exists as two simple strands of RNA packaged into a spiky protein shell containing all the enzymes it needs. The viral RNA"

But, with persistence and experience, some will succeed. Part of maturing as a scientist is recognizing these moments, understanding when to pack it in and when to keep going. Walker, at the very beginning of his career, wasn’t sure which to do. Morose, he sat looking over the botched data. Joe Sodroski, the researcher he wasn’t supposed to disturb, came up to him. “What are you working on?” Sodroski asked, concerned about Walker’s despondent attitude. Walker told Sodroski what he was trying to do and how nothing was working. Much to his surprise, Sodroski had the solution.
			 Using Sodroski’s suggestions, Walker was able to get a unique model for HIV up and running. From their conversation, he devised an artificial system in which B cells taken from patients are engineered to express individual parts of HIV. He then measured the ability of killer T cells, the storm troopers, to respond specifically to each piece. With this scheme, he was able to dissect the components of the T cell response to the virus, teasing out which parts of HIV initiate a response. Taking the storm trooper cells from their first HIV patient, Walker’s team was excited to finally measure how the body responded to HIV. What they found was dramatic. In people infected with HIV, their storm trooper T cells specifically target and kill HIV-infected cells. These killer cells knew who or what they were looking for. When storm trooper cells were taken from people not infected with the HIV virus, the cells did not know what they were looking for.

Under “compassionate use” exemptions, physicians were allowed to try other drugs, licensed for diseases other than HIV. Any drug could be repurposed to treat the virus. This approach favors the family-doctor style of medicine, often called cradle-to-grave medicine. Family physicians typically know their patients well. They are there for all their patients’ firsts; they may know their patients’ habits and quirks. They know if their patients can handle both the responsibilities and consequences of experimental drugs. Unfortunately, family doctors are in short supply. In an era when medical school tuition is soaring and interest rates for student loans are high, graduating physicians in the United States are drawn to higher-paid specialties, leaving a need for primary care doctors in nearly every state.

She used a fresh tactic to bring the need for cancer research to the public: advertising. With her husband’s help she was able to convince David Sarnoff, the CEO of NBC, to lift the ban on saying cancer on the network. So convincing were her arguments that he not only lifted the ban but also agreed to have Bob Hope deliver a message on-air about the dire need for cancer research funding. She convinced editors at Reader’s Digest to publish articles about cancer, suggesting writers capable of stirring emotions on the subject, and on at least one occasion writing a piece herself for the magazine.

The first wave is from the innate immune system, which is composed of a farrago of deterrents. It includes cannibal-like cells that eat other infected cells, and inflammation that creates a physical barricade between the infection and the rest of the body. The innate immune system can be soldiered up quickly in response to a pathogen because it uses the tools already on the shelf.
			 However, the second wave of the immune system attack, from the acquired immune system, takes more time. The acquired system develops new weapons designed for the invading pathogen. To mount its attack, the acquired system uses the blood’s infection-fighting white blood cells, specifically lymphocytes, comprised of T cells and B cells. T cells are named for the location where they become differentiated from stem cells, in the thymus, and B cells for their differentiation in bone marrow. For HIV, this “custom-made” immune response takes time, from weeks to months. The average time is about 25 days.

Even if Mars wasn’t letting on, Maniac could tell he was pleased to learn his fame had spread to the West. When they left, half the Pickwell kids followed them, begging Mars to perform his legendary feat of stopping traffic. “Don’t,” Maniac warned. “It might not work over here.” But the Pickwells persisted, and when they reached Marshall Street, Mars Bar commanded, “Stay here,” and stepped into the traffic.

Bell was astonished by how the ear’s thin membrane could move the weight of the middle ear bones: “It occurred to me that if a membrane as thin as tissue paper could control the vibration of bones that were, compared to it, of immense size and weight, why should not a larger and thicker membrane be able to vibrate a piece of iron in front of an electromagnet?”1 Beside a sketch in his notebook, he scribbled down, “Make transmitting instrument after the model of the human ear. Make armature the shape of the ossicles [small bones in the human ear]. Follow out the analogy of nature.”2
 Bell had good reason to explore this line of inquiry: both his mother and his wife were deaf, and he taught students with hearing impediments. When he built his ear phon-autograph, he used the actual bones of a human ear mounted on a wood frame. Voices caused the bones to vibrate and visually represent the sound waves as etchings on a smoked-glass plate. The invention was meant to be a tool for his deaf students, but it leapfrogged his imagination to insight that eventually led to his telephone patent in 1876.

Indeed, stress can be produced under deep anaesthesia in patients who are unconscious, and even in cell cultures grown outside the body.”3 Similarly, stress effects can be highly active in persons who are fully awake, but who are in the grip of unconscious emotions or cut off from their body responses.

These changes may be noted with the naked eye or may be evident only on microscopic examination.
			Selye’s analogies illustrate an important point: excessive stress occurs when the demands made on an organism exceed that organism’s reasonable capacities to fulfill them. The rubber band snaps, the spring becomes deformed. The stress response can be set off by physical damage, either by infection or injury. It can also be triggered by emotional trauma or just by the threat of such trauma, even if purely imaginary.

The loss of employment will be perceived as a major threat by the one, while the other may see it as an opportunity.

He was just that sort of kid—a figure of classroom fun, teased and occasionally bullied, secretly respected by some and avoided by most.” He did not look to fulfill the expectations those who had glimpsed his true abilities held for him.

In essence, she decided to devote her life to him—at great personal cost to herself, as she would come to learn. The two met just before Stephen’s diagnosis with ALS and were married shortly afterwards. Due to her own history, Jane was primed to accept the role of devoted and selfless caregiver. I write selfless here advisedly: there was lacking in her a developed, autonomous sense of self, and thus she completely identified with her role as Stephen’s nurse, mother and guardian angel. “I wanted to find some purpose to my existence,” she recalls in her 1993 memoir, Music to Move the Stars, “and I supposed I found it in the idea of looking after him.” When she doubted her ability to fulfill that daunting task, friends told her, “If he needs you, you must do it.” She took it on."

His biographers assert that “without the help that Jane gave him, he almost certainly would not have been able to carry on, or had the will to do so.”10
			The relationship worked as long as Jane accepted her self-abnegating position and the one-way flow of psychic energy between them, from wife to husband. The couple loved each other, but she would come to feel used. She recounts a strange incident when, in 1965, she arrived at her fiancé’s apartment with a broken arm in a cast: “He was actually expecting that I would put my secretarial skills to good use by typing out a job application for him. The look of horrified dismay that spread across his face as I walked into his room with my left arm bulging beneath my coat in a white plaster cast dashed all my hopes of even the merest display of sympathy.”

She travelled the world with her husband, daily confronting and overcoming myriad difficulties that were only much later—and even then only partially—eased once he became an internationally famous and high-earning author. She felt herself gradually disappear as an individual. She was sucked dry, sensing herself becoming a “brittle, empty shell, alone and vulnerable,” and nearly suicidal. Hawking, for his part, reacted to her strivings for independence with disdain and finally with the rage of a child deserted by his mother. The wife was eventually supplanted by a nurse who left her own husband to marry the scientist. Jane, too, had found another love. It was only this outside relationship that, in the final years of the marriage, allowed her to continue to serve Stephen as long as she did.

Describing herself as a “bowl of Jell-O in a wheelchair,” she sat every day for fifteen minutes in front of a mirror and chose different parts of herself to love. She started with her hands, because at that time they were the only parts of herself that she could appreciate unconditionally. Each day she went on to other body parts. . . .

The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship of psychosocial risk factors to mortality. Cvrenka, an industrial town of about fourteen thousand inhabitants, was chosen partly because it was known to have a high mortality rate and partly because its stable population base permitted easier follow-up.
			Nearly 10 per cent of the town’s inhabitants were selected, about one thousand men and four hundred women. Each was interviewed in 1965–66, with a 109-item questionnaire that delineated such risk factors as adverse life events, a sense of long-lasting hopelessness and a hyper-rational, non-emotional coping style. Physical parameters like cholesterol levels, weight, blood pressure and smoking history were also recorded. People with already diagnosed disease were excluded from the research project.
			By 1976, ten years later, over six hundred of the study participants had died of cancer, heart disease, stroke or other causes. The single greatest risk factor for death—and especially for cancer death—was what the researchers called rationality and anti-emotionality, or R/A. The eleven questions identifying R/A measured a single trait: the repression of anger. “Indeed cancer incidence was some 40 times higher in those who answered positively to 10 or 11 of the questions for R/A than in the remaining subjects, who answered positively to about 3 questions on average. . . .We found that smokers had no incidence of lung cancer unless they also had R/A scores of 10 or 11, suggesting that any effect of smoking on the lung is essentially limited to a ‘susceptible minority"

In a quarter century of clinical practice, including a decade of palliative work, I have never heard anyone with cancer or with any chronic illness or condition say yes to that question. Many children are conditioned in this manner not because of any intended harm or abuse, but because the parents themselves are too threatened by the anxiety, anger or sadness they sense in their child—or are simply too busy or too harassed themselves to pay attention. “My mother or father needed me to be happy” is the simple formula that trained many a child—later a stressed and depressed or physically ill adult—into lifelong patterns of repression"

In such studies, the functional patient groups repeatedly exhibit a hypersensitivity to distension. They report that the pain from this procedure is similar to the pain they usually experience. One study compared the effects of balloon inflation in IBS sufferers and controls. “Balloon inflation to 60 ml caused pain in 6 per cent of control subjects and 55 per cent of IBS patients. . . . Estimated gut wall tension at different volumes was similar in the two groups. However, the incidence of pain in relation to wall tension was increased by nearly ten-fold in the IBS group.”4

			What accounts for these altered nervous-system responses? The answer emerges when we look not only at human organs but at human lives. There is a high incidence of abuse in the histories of patients with intestinal diseases and especially in those patients with IBS and other functional disorders.
			In a 1990 study of women patients conducted at the gastroenterology clinic of the North Carolina School of Medicine, 44 per cent of the women reported some type of sexual and/or physical abuse. “Those with abuse history had a four-fold greater risk of pelvic pain, two to three times more non-abdominal symptoms (e.g., headaches, backaches, fatigue), as well as more lifetime surgeries.”7 In a more recent investigation at the same centre, fully two-thirds of the women interviewed had experienced abuse of a physical or sexual nature, or both. Again, abused patients were more likely to undergo various surgeries, such as gallbladder operations, hysterectomies, and laparotomies.

Such brain-gut integration is essential for survival. Large volumes of blood, for example, may need to be diverted from the intestines to the heart and to the muscles of the limbs at a moment’s notice.
			In turn, the gut is abundantly supplied with sensory nerves that carry information to the brain. Quite to the contrary of what was believed until recently, nerve fibres ascending from the intestines to the brain greatly outnumber ones descending from brain to gut.10
			The brain relays to the gut data from sensory organs such as the eyes, the skin or the ears—or more correctly, relayed to the gut is the interpretation of such data by the brain’s emotional centres. The resulting physiological events in the gut then reinforce that emotional interpretation. The signals sent back to the brain give rise to gut feelings that we can apprehend consciously. If we lose touch with gut feelings, the world becomes less safe.
			Obviously, life would not be livable if we felt every micro-event in our bodies. Digestion, breathing, blood flow to organs or limbs and myriad other functions must take place without intruding on consciousness. There has to be a threshold below which the brain does not register sensation, below which stimuli are accepted as unremarkable but above which the brain will be alerted to potential danger from within or without. There needs to be, in other words, a well-calibrated thermostat for pain and other sensations.
			When there are too many “gut-wrenching” experiences, the neurological apparatus can become oversensitized. Thus, in the spinal cord the conduction of pain from gut to brain is adjusted as a result of psychological trauma. The nerves involved are set off by weaker stimuli. The greater the trauma, the lower becomes the sensory threshold. A normal amount of gas in the intestinal lumen and a normal level of tension in the intestinal wall will trigger pain in the sensitized person.

Researchers in 1992 studied the relationship of reflux symptoms to stress in subjects diagnosed with GERD. While the perception of reflux-associated heartburn by these patients was markedly increased during the stressful stimuli, the objective measures of acid levels were unchanged from one stimulus to another. Stress, in other words, lowered the pain threshold.13
			An intestinal specialist unfamiliar with the neurophysiology or psychology of pain who looked at Patricia’s lower esophagus through an endoscope could, in good conscience, tell her that the acid reflux he observed was inadequate to explain the degree of her pain. And Patricia, in equally good conscience, would be incensed by what she perceived as the callous dismissal of a symptom that is a source of intense daily discomfort in her life.
			This is not to say that people with GERD do not experience more frequent reflux than other people. They probably do, and, once more, it is a brain-gut problem. Investigators comparing healthy controls with reflux patients found that the resting pressure of the esophageal sphincter was more frequently low in the GERD subjects. The decreased efficiency of the sphincter muscles permitted more episodes of reflux.14
			How can the mind and the brain contribute to reflux? It happens by means of the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the tone of the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter. In turn, the activity of the vagus is influenced by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, as we have seen, receives input from the emotional centres in the cortex that are susceptible to stress. Thus, in GERD, a lower pain threshold is combined with excessive relaxation of the sphincter—both phenomena that can be related to stress.

More than six decades later, researchers asked to see the autobiographical statements each had made, and in addition, these now aged nuns were examined for mental health and acuity. As part of the study, each nun was asked and gave permission for an autopsy to be performed after her death.

			He was also known to confuse fiction and reality. There had been the anecdote he had told Medal of Honor winners about the Eighth Air Force bomber pilot who, when his B-17 was mortally hit by flak, ordered the crew to parachute out. Just as the pilot was about to jump from the flaming aircraft himself, he discovered that the ball gunner was trapped in his turret, wounded and unable to get out of the hatch above him, terrified of dying alone. The pilot took off his parachute. . . . and lay down on the floor so that he could put his arm into the turret and hold the dying boy’s hand. “Don’t sweat it, son,” he told the gunner, “we’ll go down together,” as the plane plunged to the ground.
			This brought tears to Reagan’s eyes and to the eyes of the Medal of Honor winners. The only problem, as the press soon discovered, was that it had never happened. It was a scene from a movie, which the president had unwittingly transposed to real life.12

In the eavesdropping scenario, there is nothing that we might recognize as deliberate behavior on the part of the sender. As Kiers explained, “If a tree gets attacked by an insect then of course it’s going to scream in its language: It will produce some sort of chemical to get ready for the attack.” These chemicals could easily spill over from one plant into another through the network. Nothing is actively sent. The receiver plant just happens to notice. Johnson uses the same analogy. If we hear someone screaming, it doesn’t mean they are screaming in order to warn us of something. Sure, a scream may cause us to change our behavior, but it doesn’t imply any intention on the part of the screamer. “You’re just eavesdropping on their response to a particular situation.”
			
			 It may seem like splitting hairs, but a lot turns on which way we read the interaction. Either way, a stimulus moves from one plant to another and allows the receiver to prepare itself for attack. However, if plants do send a message, we would think of it as a signal. If their neighbors are eavesdropping, we would think of it as a cue. How best to interpret the behavior of shared mycorrhizal networks is a sensitive subject. Some researchers are concerned about how wood wide webs are commonly portrayed. “Just because we found that plants can respond to a neighbor,” Johnson told me, “doesn’t mean that there is some altruistic network in operation.” The idea that plants are talking to each other and warning each other of imminent attack is an anthropomorphic delusion. “It’s very attractive to think that way,” he admitted, but it’s ultimately “a load of nonsense.”

Adamatzky estimates that a network of honey fungus stretching over fifteen hectares would have nearly a trillion such processing units.
			 For Adamatzky, the point of fungal computers is not to replace silicon chips. Fungal reactions are too slow for that. Rather, he thinks humans could use mycelium growing in an ecosystem as a “large-scale environmental sensor.” Fungal networks, he reasons, are monitoring a large number of data streams as part of their everyday existence. If we could plug into mycelial networks and interpret the signals they use to process information, we could learn more about what was happening in an ecosystem. Fungi could report changes in soil quality, water purity, pollution, or any other features of the environment that they are sensitive to.
			 We’re some way off. Computing with living network-based organisms is in its infancy and many questions remain unanswered. Olsson and Adamatzky have shown that mycelium can be electrically sensitive, but they haven’t shown that electrical impulses can link a stimulus to a response. It is as if you had stuck a pin in your toe, detected the nerve impulse that traveled through your body, but hadn’t been able to measure your reaction to the pain.
			
			 This is a challenge for the future. In the twenty-three years between Olsson’s study on mycelium and Adamatzky’s study on oyster mushrooms, no further research was conducted on electrical signaling in fungi. If he had the resources to pursue this line of inquiry, Olsson told me that he would try to demonstrate a clear physiological response to changes in electrical activity and decode the patterns of electrical impulses. His dream is to “hook up a fungus with a computer and communicate with it,” to use electrical signals to get the fungus to change its behavior. “All sorts of weird and wonderful experiments could be done if this turns out to be right.”"

Why bother to make it in the first place? It’s a question that has been pored over for decades by mycologists and magic-mushroom enthusiasts alike.
			
			 It’s possible that psilocybin didn’t do much at all for the fungi that made it until humans came along. There are lots of compounds in fungi and plants that accumulate in biochemical backwaters playing Z-list roles as incidental metabolic by-products. Sometimes these “secondary compounds” encounter an animal that they attract, confound, or kill, at which point they might start to benefit the fungus and become an evolutionary adaptation. However, sometimes they don’t do much more than provide variations on a biochemical theme that might one day prove useful, or not.

He tested this possibility by growing two genetically identical mycelia side by side. There were no direct connections between them, but they were close enough that chemicals drifting through the air would traverse the gap. Olsson stabbed one of the networks.

Eukaryotes arose when a single-celled organism engulfed a bacterium, which continued to live symbiotically inside it. Mitochondria were the descendants of these bacteria. Chloroplasts were the descendants of photosynthetic bacteria that had been engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell. All complex life that followed, human life included, was a story of the long-lasting “intimacy of strangers.”

By some measures, modern industrial agriculture has been effective: Crop production doubled over the second half of the twentieth century. But a single-minded focus on yield has incurred steep costs. Agriculture causes widespread environmental destruction and is responsible for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Between twenty and forty percent of crops are lost each year to pests and diseases, despite colossal applications of pesticides. Global agricultural yields have plateaued, despite a seven-hundred-fold increase in fertilizer use over the second half of the twentieth century. Worldwide, thirty football fields’ worth of topsoil are lost to erosion every minute. Yet a third of food is wasted, and demand for crops will double by 2050. It is difficult to overstate the urgency of the crisis.
			
			 Could mycorrhizal fungi form part of the solution? Perhaps it’s a silly question. Mycorrhizal relationships are as old as plants and have been shaping Earth’s future for hundreds of millions of years. They have forever featured in our efforts to feed ourselves, whether we’ve thought about them or not. For millennia in many parts of the world, traditional agricultural practices have attended to the health of the soil, and thus supported plants’ fungal relationships implicitly. But over the course of the twentieth century, our neglect has led us into trouble. In 1940, Howard’s greatest worry was that industrial agricultural techniques would develop without taking account of the “life of the soil.” His concern was justified. In viewing soils as more or less lifeless places, agricultural practices have ravaged the underground communities that sustain the life we eat. There are parallels with much of twentieth-century medical science, which considered “germ” and “microbe” to mean the same thing. Of course some soil organisms, like some microbes that live on your body, can cause disease. Most do quite the opposite. Disrupt the ecology of microbes that live in your gut, and your health will suffer—a growing number of human diseases are known to arise because of efforts to rid ourselves of “germs.” Disrupt the rich ecology of microbes that live in the soil—the guts of the planet—and the health of plants, too, will suffer.

Instead, he argued that they were composed of two quite different entities: a fungus and an alga. Schwendener proposed that the lichen fungus (known today as the “mycobiont”) offered physical protection and acquired nutrients for itself and for the algal cells. The algal partner (known today as the “photobiont,” a role sometimes played by photosynthetic bacteria) harvested light and carbon dioxide to make sugars that provided energy. In Schwendener’s view, the fungal partners were “parasites, although with the wisdom of statesmen.” The algal partners were “its slaves…which it has sought out…and forced into its service.” Together they grew into the visible body of the lichen. In their relationship, both partners were able to make a life in places where neither could survive alone."

The process is comparatively nuance-free. To attract an animal the aroma has to be curious, and delicious—yes. But most of all it has to be penetrating and strong. It doesn’t really matter whether their spores are scattered by a wild boar or a flying squirrel, so why be picky? Most hungry animals will chase a delicious smell. Moreover, a truffle doesn’t change its aroma in response to your immediate attentions. It can excite, but it isn’t excitable. Its signal billows out loud and clear, and once begun, it is always on. A ripe truffle broadcasts an unambiguous summons in chemical lingua franca, a pop scent with mass appeal that could cause Daniele, Paride, two dogs, a mouse, and me to converge at a single point under a bramble bush on a muddy bank in Italy.
			 Truffles—like many other highly prized fungal fruiting bodies—are their parent fungus’s least sophisticated channels of communication. Much of fungal life, including the growth of mycelium, depends on subtler forms of allure. There are two key moves by which fungal hyphae become a mycelial network. First, they branch. Second, they fuse. (The process by which hyphae merge with each other is known as “anastomosis,” which in Greek means “to provide with a mouth.”) If hyphae couldn’t branch, one hypha could never become many. If hyphae couldn’t fuse with one another, they would not be able to grow into complex networks. However, before they fuse, hyphae must find other hyphae, which they do by attracting one another, a phenomenon known as “homing.” Fusion between hyphae is the linking stitch that makes mycelium mycelium, the most basic networking act. In this sense, the mycelium of any fungus arises from its ability to attract itself to itself.

A new character was introduced, a brilliant astromycologist called Lieutenant Paul Stamets, who uses fungi to develop powerful technologies that can be deployed to save humanity in a fight against a series of terminal threats. The Star Trek team has taken plenty of license, though they hardly needed to.

Soon afterward, I moved to a field station on an island run by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. The island and surrounding peninsulas were part of a nature reserve entirely covered by forest, apart from a clearing for dormitories, a canteen, and lab buildings. There were greenhouses for growing plants, drying cupboards filled with bags of leaf litter, a room lined with microscopes, and a walk-in freezer packed with samples: bottles of tree sap, dead bats, tubes containing ticks pulled from the backs of spiny rats and boa constrictors. Posters on the notice board offered cash rewards to anyone who could source fresh ocelot droppings from the forest.
			 The jungle bristled with life. There were sloths, pumas, snakes, crocodiles; there were basilisk lizards that could run across the surface of water without sinking. In just a few hectares there lived as many woody plant species as in the whole of Europe. The diversity of the forest was reflected in the rich variety of field biologists who came there to study it. Some climbed trees and observed ants. Some set out at dawn every day to follow the monkeys. Some tracked the lightning that struck trees during tropical storms. Some spent their days suspended from a crane measuring ozone concentrations in the forest canopy. Some warmed up the soil using electrical elements to see how bacteria might respond to global heating. Some studied the way beetles navigate using the stars. Bumblebees, orchids, butterflies—there seemed to be no aspect of life in the forest that someone wasn’t observing.
			
			 I was struck by the creativity and humor of this community of researchers. Lab biologists spend most of their time in charge of the pieces of life they study. Their own human lives are lived outside the flasks that contain their subject matter. Field biologists rarely have so much control. The world is the flask and they’re inside it. The balance of power is different. Storms wash away the flags that mark their experiments. Trees fall on their plots. Sloths die where they planned to measure the nutrients in the soil. Bullet ants sting them as they crash past. The forest and its inhabitants dispel any illusions that scientists are in charge. Humility quickly sets in.

			 The ability to detect and respond to chemicals is a primordial sensory ability. Most organisms use their chemical senses to explore and make sense of their environment. Plants, fungi, and animals all use similar types of receptors to detect chemicals. When molecules bind to these receptors, they trigger a signaling cascade: One molecule triggers a cellular change, which triggers a bigger change, and so on. In this way, small causes can ripple into large effects: Human noses can detect some compounds at as low a concentration as thirty-four thousand molecules in one square centimeter, the equivalent of a single drop of water in twenty thousand Olympic swimming pools.

In other situations, lichen fungi produce spores that travel alone. Upon arrival in a new place, the fungus must meet a compatible photobiont and form their relationship afresh.

As Goward emphasizes, it is a point so simple that it is hard to grasp. “I often say that the only people who can’t see a lichen are lichenologists.

It was either for bread or for beer that humans started to give up their nomadic lifestyles and settle into sedentary societies (the beer-before-bread hypothesis has steadily gained traction among scholars since the 1980s).

As soon as one says it, people start thinking of brains like ours where we have language and process thoughts to make decisions.” His caution is well-placed. Brain is a trigger word, burdened with concepts that spend most of their time in the animal world. “When we say ‘brain,’ ” Olsson continued, “all associations are with animal brains.” Besides, as he pointed out, brains behave like brains because of the way they’re built. The architecture of animal brains is very different from that of fungal networks. In animal brains, neurons connect with other neurons at junctions called synapses. At synapses, signals can combine with other signals. Neurotransmitter molecules pass across synapses and allow different neurons to behave in different ways—some excite other neurons, some inhibit them. Mycelial networks don’t share any of these features.
			
			 But if fungi did use waves of electrical activity to transmit signals around a network, wouldn’t we think of mycelium as at least a brain-like phenomenon? In Olsson’s view, there could be other ways to regulate electrical impulses in mycelial networks to create “brain-like circuits, gates, and oscillators.” In some fungi, hyphae are divided into compartments by pores, which can be sensitively regulated. Opening or closing a pore changes the strength of the signal that passes from one compartment to another, whether chemical, pressure, or "

Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the living. A portion of the minerals in your body is likely to have passed through a lichen at some point.

They are coated with proteins that insulate them, which would allow waves of electrical activity to travel long distances without dissipating—animal nerve cells have an analogous insulating sheath. Moreover, the cells in a mycelium are continuous with one another, possibly allowing impulses initiated in one part of the network to reach another part without interruption.
			 Olsson chose the species of fungus carefully. He surmised that if electrical communication systems did exist in fungi, it would be easier to detect in species with a greater need for communication over long distances. Just to be safe, he chose a honey fungus, or Armillaria—the species that forms the record-holding mycelial networks that stretch over kilometers and reach thousands of years in age.
			 When Olsson inserted the microelectrodes into Armillaria’s hyphal strands, he detected regular action potential–like impulses, firing at a rate very close to that of animals’ sensory neurons—around four impulses per second, which traveled along hyphae at a speed of at least half a millimeter per second, some ten times faster than the fastest rate of fluid flow measured in a fungal hypha. This caught his attention, but in itself it didn’t suggest that the impulses formed the basis of a rapid signaling system. Electrical activity can only play a role in fungal communication if it is sensitive to stimulation. Olsson decided to measure the response of the fungus to blocks of wood, which is food for this species.
			 Olsson set up the rig and placed a block of wood onto the mycelium several centimeters from the electrodes. What he found was extraordinary. When the wood came into contact with the mycelium, the firing rate of the impulses doubled. When he removed the block of wood, the firing rate returned to normal. To make sure that the fungi weren’t responding to the weight of the wooden block, he placed an inedible plastic block of the same size and weight onto the mycelium. The fungus didn’t respond.

It is a question that came to preoccupy Lucy Gilbert and David Johnson, then working at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. To find out, they set up a deft experiment. Broad bean plants were either allowed to connect to a shared mycorrhizal network or prevented from doing so using a fine nylon mesh. The mesh allowed water and chemicals to pass, but prevented direct contact between the fungi connected to different plants. Once the plants had grown, aphids were allowed to attack the leaves of one of the plants in the network. Plastic bags placed over the plants prevented the transmission of infochemicals through the air.
			 Gilbert and Johnson found clear confirmation of their hypothesis. Plants that were connected to the aphid-infested plant via a shared fungal network ramped up their production of volatile defense compounds, even though they had not encountered the aphids themselves. The plumes of volatile compounds produced by the plants were large enough to attract the parasitic wasps, suggesting that information passing between the plants through the fungal channel could make a difference in a real-world setting. Gilbert described this to me as a “completely new” finding. It revealed a previously unknown role for shared mycorrhizal networks. Not only could a donor plant influence a receiver but its influence could leak out beyond the receiver in the form of volatile chemicals. A shared mycorrhizal network influenced not only the relationship between two plants but also the relationship between two plants, their aphid pests, and their wasp allies.

			 Once inside the body, psilocybin is converted to the chemical psilocin. Psilocin slips into the workings of the brain by stimulating receptors normally stimulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin.

A number of years ago, at a conference on mycorrhizal relationships, I met a researcher who had been growing strawberry plants with different communities of mycorrhizal fungus. The experiment was simple. If the same species of strawberry was grown with different species of fungus, would the flavor of the strawberries change? He conducted blind taste tests and found that different fungal communities did seem to change the flavor of the fruit. Some had more flavor, some were juicier, some were sweeter.
			 When he repeated the experiment a second year running, unpredictable weather swamped the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the taste of the strawberries, but a number of other striking effects surfaced. Bumblebees were more attracted to the flowers of strawberry plants grown with some fungal species and less attracted to others. Plants grown with some mycorrhizal species produced more berries than others. And the appearance of the berries changed depending on which fungi they partnered with. Some mycorrhizal communities made the berries look more appealing, some less so.
			 Strawberries aren’t alone in being sensitive to the identity of their fungal partners. Most plants—from a potted snapdragon to a giant sequoia—will develop differently when grown with different communities of mycorrhizal fungus. Basil plants, for example, produce different profiles of the aromatic oils that make up their flavor when grown with different mycorrhizal strains. Some fungi have been found to make tomatoes sweeter than others; some change the essential oil profile of fennel, coriander, and mint; some increase the concentration of iron and carotenoids in lettuce leaves, the antioxidant activity in artichoke heads, or the concentrations of medicinal compounds in Saint-John’s-wort and echinacea. In 2013, a team of Italian researchers baked loaves of bread using wheat that had been grown with different mycorrhizal communities. The bread was subjected to testing with an electronic nose and a tasting panel consisting of ten “well-trained testers” at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy. (Each tester, the authors assert reassuringly, “had a minimum of two years’ experience in sensory evaluation.”) Surprisingly, given how many stages occur between harvest and tasting—milling, mixing, and baking, besides the addition of yeast—both the panel and the electronic nose were able to tell the loaves apart. The bread grown with an enhanced mycorrhizal fungal community had a higher “flavor intensity” and improved “elasticity and crumbliness.” By smelling a flower, by chewing on twigs, leaves, or bark, by drinking a wine, how many other aspects of a plant’s mycorrhizal underground might we be able to taste?

The researchers at Agroscope describe them as keystone organisms but some prefer the term “ecosystem engineers.” Mycorrhizal mycelium is a sticky living seam that holds soil together; remove the fungi, and the ground washes away. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the volume of water that the soil can absorb, reducing the quantity of nutrients leached out of the soil by rainfall by as much as fifty percent. Of the carbon that is found in soils—which, remarkably, amounts to twice the amount of carbon found in plants and the atmosphere combined—a substantial proportion is bound up in tough organic compounds produced by mycorrhizal fungi. The carbon that floods into the soil through mycorrhizal channels supports intricate food webs.

She and her team exposed a single mycorrhizal fungus to an unequal supply of phosphorus. One part of the mycelium had access to a big patch of phosphorus. Another part had access to a small patch. She was interested in how this would affect the fungus’s trading decisions in different parts of the same network. Some recognizable patterns emerged. In parts of a mycelial network where phosphorus was scarce, the plant paid a higher “price,” supplying more carbon to the fungus for every unit of phosphorus it received. Where phosphorus was more readily available, the fungus received a less favorable “exchange rate.” The “price” of phosphorus seemed to be governed by the familiar dynamics of supply and demand.
			
			 Most surprising was the way that the fungus coordinated its trading behavior across the network. Kiers identified a strategy of “buy low, sell high.” The fungus actively transported phosphorus—using its dynamic microtubule “motors”—from areas of abundance, where it fetched a low price when exchanged with a plant root, to areas of scarcity, where it was in higher demand and fetched a higher price. By doing so, the fungus was able to transfer a greater proportion of its phosphorus to the plant at the more favorable exchange rate, thus receiving larger quantities of carbon in return.
			 How are these behaviors controlled? Can the fungus detect differences in exchange rate across its network and actively transport phosphorus to play the system? Or does it always transport phosphorus within its network from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity, sometimes receiving a payoff from the plant, and sometimes not? We still don’t know. Nonetheless, Kiers’s studies illuminate some of the intricacies of plant and fungal exchange, and show how solutions to complex challenges are able to emerge. All of these behaviors illustrate a general pattern. How a given plant or fungus behaves depends on who they find themselves partnering with and where they happen to be.

Many major developments in the history of the sciences have been fueled by amateur enthusiasm and taken place outside dedicated university departments. Today, after a long period of specialization and professionalization, there is an explosion of new ways of doing science. “Citizen science projects,” along with “hackerspaces” and “makerspaces,” have grown increasingly popular since the 1990s, providing opportunities for dedicated nonspecialists to carry out research projects. What does one call these practitioners? Do they count as the “public”? Citizen scientists? Lay experts? Or just amateurs?"

The amount of carbon obtained by the fir trees—on average six percent of the labeled carbon taken up by the birch—was, by Simard’s reckoning, a meaningful transfer: Over time, one would expect this to make a difference to the life of the trees.

Between them, they are able to strike compromises, resolve trade-offs, and deploy sophisticated trading strategies. In one set of experiments, she found that plant roots were able to supply carbon preferentially to fungal strains that provided them with more phosphorus. In return, fungi that received more carbon from the plant supplied it with yet more phosphorus. Exchange was in some sense negotiated between the two depending on the availability of resources. Kiers hypothesized that these “reciprocal rewards” have helped to keep plant and fungal associations stable over evolutionary time. Because both partners share control of the exchange, neither partner would be able to hijack the relationship for their own exclusive benefit.
			
			 Although both plants and fungi tend to benefit from the relationship overall, different species of plant and fungus have different symbiotic manners. Some fungi make more cooperative partners; some are less cooperative and will “hoard” phosphorus rather than exchange it with their plant partners. However, even a hoarder might not hoard all the time. Their behavior is flexible, a set of ongoing negotiations that depend on what is taking place around them and in other parts of themselves. We don’t know much about the workings of these behaviors, but it’s clear that at any one moment plants and fungi face a number of options. And options entail choices, however those choices turn out to be made—whether in a conscious human mind, an unconscious computer algorithm, or anything in between.

By growing a dense network, mycelium can increase its capacity for transport, but dense networks aren’t good for exploring across large distances. Sparse networks are better for foraging across large areas but have fewer interconnections and so are more vulnerable to damage. How do fungi juggle this kind of trade-off while exploring a crowded rotscape in search of food?
			 Boddy’s experiment with two blocks of wood illustrates a typical sequence of events. The mycelium starts in an exploratory mode, proliferating in all directions. Setting out to find water in a desert, we’d have to pick one direction to explore. Fungi can choose all possible routes at once. If the fungus discovers something to eat, it reinforces the links that connect it with the food and prunes back the links that don’t lead anywhere. One can think of it in terms of natural selection. Mycelium overproduces links. Some turn out to be more competitive than others. These links are thickened. Less competitive links are withdrawn, leaving a few mainline highways. By growing in one direction while pulling back from another, mycelial networks can even migrate through a landscape. The Latin root of the word extravagant means “to wander outside or beyond.” It is a good word for mycelium, which ceaselessly wanders outside and beyond its limits, none of which are preset as they are in most animal bodies.

In 2018, he inserted electrodes into whole oyster mushrooms sprouting in clusters from blocks of mycelium and detected spontaneous waves of electrical activity. When he held a flame up to a mushroom, different mushrooms within the cluster responded with a sharp electrical spike. Shortly afterward, he published a paper called “Towards fungal computer.” In it, he proposed that mycelial networks “compute” information encoded in spikes of electrical activity. If we knew how a mycelial network would respond to a given stimulus, Adamatzky argues, we could treat it like a living circuit board. By stimulating the mycelium—for example, using a flame or a chemical—we could input data into the fungal computer.
			
			 A fungal computer may sound fantastical, but biocomputing is a fast-growing field. Adamatzky has spent years developing ways to use slime molds as sensors and computers. These prototype biocomputers use slime molds to solve a range of geometrical problems.

The myth was strong enough to make three separate academic committees—known for their caution and indecision above all else—decide to plant the trees in auspicious places around the town.

The most detailed account was written by William Stukeley, a young fellow of the Royal Society and antiquarian best-known today for his works on Britain’s stone circles. In 1726, Stukeley recalled, he and Newton ate together in London:
			 
				 After dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden & drank thea under the shade of some apple tree; only he & myself…Amid other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into his mind. Why shd that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself; occasion’d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why shd it not go sideways, or upward? But constantly to the Earth’s center? Assuredly the reason is, that the Earth draws it. There must be a drawing power in matter.
			
			 The modern story of Newton’s apple is a story about a story about what Newton said. This is what made the trees so narratively rich. It was impossible to verify the story either way. In response to this quandary, the academics acted as if it were both true and false. The story shuttled in and out of legend. The trees were saddled with an impossible narrative, an example of the way nonhuman organisms stretch the seams of our categories to breaking point. Whether an apple had actually inspired Newton to derive his theory of gravitation had long ceased to matter. The trees grew; the story thrived.

Their leather-like textile replaces animal leather. Hundreds of square feet of mycelial leather can be grown in less than a week on materials that would otherwise be disposed of. At the end of their life, mycelial products can be composted. Ecovative’s materials are lightweight, water resistant, and fire retardant. They are stronger than concrete when subjected to bending forces and resist compression better than wood framing. They have a better insulation value than expanded polystyrene and can be grown in a matter of days into an unlimited number of forms (researchers in Australia are working to create a termite-resistant brick by combining Trametes mycelium with crushed glass—a product that would avoid the need for Stamets’s termite-killing fungi).
			 The potential of mycelial materials has not gone unnoticed. The designer Stella McCartney is working with fungal leather grown using Ecovative’s methods. Ecovative has a close relationship with IKEA, who are developing ways to replace their polystyrene packaging with a mycelial alternative. Researchers at NASA have taken an interest in “mycotecture” and its potential role in growing structures on the moon. Ecovative has just received a $10 million research and development contract from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a wing of the US military. DARPA is interested in growing barracks out of mycelium that repair themselves when damaged and decompose when their job is done. Growing housing for soldiers hadn’t been part of Bayer’s original vision, but these are adaptable techniques. “We can use these methods to grow relief shelters in disaster zones,” Bayer pointed out. “Using mycelium, you can grow a lot of housing for a lot of people at really low cost.”

Such a conclusion is quite contrary to my intentions and entirely out of keeping with the scientific evidence. Parenting styles do not reflect greater or lesser degrees of love in the heart of the mother and father; other, more mundane factors are at play. Parental love is infinite and for a very practical reason: the selfless nurturing of the young is embedded in the attachment apparatus of the mammalian brain.
			If a parent’s loving feelings are constricted, it only because that parent has himself or herself suffered deep hurt. In my work with drug addicts in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, I treat many substance-dependent men and women. Hardened as they are—with their criminal records, their continued drug-seeking, their HIV infections and their harassed and socially marginal lives—the deepest pain they all have is about the children whom they have abandoned or who have been taken from them. Without exception, they themselves were abused or abandoned in childhood.
			Where parenting fails to communicate unconditional acceptance to the child, it is because of the fact that the child receives the parent’s love not as the parent wishes but as it is refracted through the parent’s personality. If the parent is stressed, harbours unresolved anxiety or is agitated by unmet emotional needs, the child is likely to find herself in situations of proximate abandonment regardless of the parent’s intentions.

They were soothed easily and returned quickly to spontaneous play. This pattern was called secure. There were also a number of insecure patterns, variously named avoidant, ambivalent or disorganized. Avoidant infants did not express distress on separating from the mother and avoided or ignored the mother on reunion.

People who are not adaptive may seem to function well as long as nothing is disturbing them, but they will react with various levels of frustration and helplessness when confronted by loss or by difficulty. They will blame themselves or blame others. A person’s adaptiveness depends very much on the degree of differentiation and adaptiveness of previous generations in his family and also on what external stressors may have acted on the family.

The multigenerational history of particular families enabled some to adapt and cope, while other families, facing the same economic scarcities, were psychologically devastated.

			Since one important variable in the development of physical illness is the degree of adaptiveness of an individual, and since the degree of adaptiveness is determined by the multigenerational emotional process, physical illness, like emotional illness, is a symptom of a relationship process that extends beyond the boundaries of the individual “patient.” Physical illness, in other words, is a disorder of the family emotional system [which includes] present and past generations."

			Of course, the nucleus is not the brain of the cell. The brain is our organ of decision making, and it is the brain that acts as our interface with the environment.

Although the scientific information uncovered is important for its own sake, very little can be expected from the genome program that will lead to broad health benefits in the near future, if ever.
			First, there are many technical problems still to be solved. Our current state of knowledge about the genetic makeup of human beings may be likened to using a copy of The Concise Oxford English Dictionary as “the model” from which the plays of William Shakespeare or the novels of Charles Dickens were created. “All” that remains to duplicate their work now is to find the prepositions, grammatical rules and phonetic indications, then to figure out how the two authors arrived at their storylines, dialogues and sublime literary devices. “The genome is the biological programming,” one of the more thoughtful science reporters wrote, “but evolution has neglected to provide even the punctuation to show where genes stop and start, let alone any helpful notes as to what each gene is meant to do.”

Genes are merely codes. They act as a set of rules and as a biological template for the synthesis of the proteins that give each particular cell its characteristic structure and functions. They are, as it were, alive and dynamic architectural and mechanical plans. Whether the plan becomes realized depends on far more than the gene itself. Genes exist and function in the context of living organisms. The activities of cells are defined not simply by the genes in their nuclei but by the requirements of the entire organism—and by the interaction of that organism with the environment in which it must survive. Genes are turned on or off by the environment. For this reason, the greatest influences on human development, health and behaviour are those of the nurturing environment.
			Hardly anyone who raises plants or animals would ever dispute the primary role of early care in shaping how genetic endowment and potential will unfold. For reasons that have little to do with science, many people have difficulty grasping the same concept when it comes to the development of human beings. This paralysis of thought is all the more ironic, since of all animal species it is the human whose long-term functioning is most profoundly regulated by the early environment."

Then, in the cell membrane—depending on how receptive the cell is at that moment—effector substances are produced that go to the nucleus, instructing the genes to synthesize particular proteins to carry out specific functions. These receptor-effector protein complexes—called perception proteins—Bruce Lipton explains, act as the “switches” that integrate the function of the cell with its environment:
			Although perception proteins are manufactured through molecular genetic mechanisms, activation of the perception process is “controlled” or initiated by environmental signals. . . . The controlling influence of the environment is underscored in recent studies on stem cells.* Stem cells do not control their own fate. The differentiation of stem cells is based upon the environment the cell finds itself in. For example, three different tissue culture environments can be created. If a stem cell is placed in culture number one, it may become a bone cell. If the same stem cell was put into culture two, it will become a nerve cell, or if placed into culture dish number three, the cell matures as a liver cell. The cell’s fate is “controlled” by its interaction with the environment and not by a self-contained genetic program.1"

Our perceptions of the environment are stored in cellular memory. When early environmental influences are chronically stressful, the developing nervous system and the other organs of the PNI super-system repeatedly receive the electric, hormonal and chemical message that the world is unsafe or even hostile. Those perceptions are programmed in our cells on the molecular level. Early experiences condition the body’s stance toward the world and determine the person’s unconscious beliefs about herself in relationship to the world. Dr. Lipton calls that process the biology of belief. Fortunately, human experience and the ever-unfolding potential of human beings ensure that the biology of belief, though deeply physiologically ingrained, is not irreversible.

Each one united their people during a time of exceptional chaos or opportunity. None have had as broad or long-lasting an impact on Prodryan culture as the first.
			In typical Prodryan nomenclature, the first Supreme War Leader of Yan went by the name “Supreme War Leader.” History describes him as a prodigy, born nine hundred years ago in a remote hive in the icy wastelands of Yan’s southernmost continent. The only survivor of a barbarian raid, Supreme War Leader set out on a mission of vengeance at the age of eleven. For three years, he tracked and slaughtered those responsible for the attack on his home.
			During this time, he revolutionized military tactics and invented seven new distance weapons, including the barbed bola and the wing spear. His poetry from this period was collected and published as Supreme War Poems, Part 1, and remains on the Prodryan bestseller list to this day.
			By the time Supreme War Leader finished his mission of vengeance, he had gained many disciples, drawn by his tactical genius and innate charisma. He spent the following eight years traveling the world at the head of this personal army, bringing law and order and civilization to the surrounding lands. Early battles were difficult, but as his reputation and his army grew, other clans surrendered more quickly. Soon, Prodryans were eager to submit to his leadership.
			At the age of twenty-four, Supreme War Leader received his name and title by a unanimous vote of Yan’s surviving clan leaders. (Six clan leaders voted against him, but they were promptly killed, so are not included as survivors.)

			“I don’t think I can shoot him from here.”

Can your uniform be programmed to a better color scheme? Your blandness makes you too easy to overlook. Of everyone on this ship, only Gabe displays the sartorial sense of a true warrior.”
			Behind Cate, Monroe fought to hide his laughter.
			“What color would you recommend?” asked Mops, her voice dangerously soft.
			He studied her more closely. “The blazing orange of your sun. I always wore sky-themed armor when I worked in Prodryan courts, and as you know, my record of success was most impressive.”
			“So you’ve said.” She took a calming breath. This sort of advice, no matter how obnoxiously delivered, was exactly the reason she’d kept the Prodryan on board. “Doc?”
			“Preparing smart fabric updates now.”

			Monroe folded his arms and raised one eyebrow, an unspoken warning that probably would have gone over Cate’s head even if he hadn’t been focused on Mops’ uniform.
			The change began at her collar and flowed swiftly downward, the black brightening to a brilliant orange.
			Mops raised her arms. “I look like a signal flare.”
			“I agree,” said Cate. “You haven’t the stature to pull this look off. Have your AI add sky-blue trim.”
			Blue splotches appeared on her shoulders, chest, and legs, a symmetrical pattern split down the center. Her insignia became a bleached white. If she squinted hard, she could see how the additions made her look vaguely like a stocky, thick-limbed Prodryan with her wings wrapped around her body.
			“Better.” Cate circled her. “The rest of the crew should remain silent and submissive at all times to emphasize your power. Keep the men offscreen if possible so their superior strength and size don’t detract from—”
			It was then that Rubin entered the bridge carrying a pistol and baton. “Commander Monroe said you needed these for props, sir?”
			“Very good.” Cate hurried over, plucked the weapons from her hands, and brought them to Mops. “Make sure they’re displayed as conspicuously as possible.”
			Mops hooked the pistol to the front of her harness, then hung the baton from her left hip. Not where she’d normally carry them, but they should be hard to miss. “Rubin, in the future, please avoid handing guns to the enemy spy.”
			“It’s a dummy pistol from the combat range,” said Rubin.
			Mops checked the gun more closely. She should have noticed that herself. “Good work, thank you.”
			“I don’t suppose we have time to recolor your weapons? No, I suppose not.” Cate completed another circle, his mandibles clicking and scraping. “Human eyes are so puny. The monocle helps a little . . . I suppose that’s all we can hope for. Would you be willing to shave your head fur? My people find it repulsive.”

Typical Prodryan approach. One group would probably attack head-on, while the other two hit from the sides. “Johnny, it’s time!”
			“Excellent!” Johnny’s tentacles reached over Rubin’s shoulders to prep the A-rings. “Grom, I’ll require your assistance. Rubin, keep our beak pointed at the center ships.”
			Rubin shoved a tentacle aside and adjusted the controls, turning the Pufferfish until the ship faced directly away from the planet.
			Monroe activated a communications channel. “Swift Death, this is Commander Monroe. If you shoot us down, you’ll never have the chance to redeem your zero-and-four checkers record.”

			“Launching A-rings now,” said Johnny. “First four rings are away. Preparing rings five through eight.”
			“Not yet,” shouted Grom. “Let me get these anchored into position first.”
			Even four rings were three more than anyone was supposed to deploy at one time. Johnny and Grom had been working tirelessly to split off the controls that maneuvered and locked the rings into place. It meant reducing power and precision to the grav beams, but so far, it appeared to be working.
			The four rings slowly expanded to their maximum diameter, wide enough for the Pufferfish to pass through.
			“Spinning rings one through four up to three percent power,” said Johnny. “We could go as high as five percent before the gravity from Tuxatl and its sun interferes, but I’d rather not push it.”
			“By all means,” agreed Monroe. “Let’s stick with one potentially disastrous experiment at a time.”
			Swift Death’s voice crackled over the speakers. “We are familiar with Captain Adamopoulos’ tactics, Commander Monroe. Using your A-rings to try to hurl Prodryan missiles back at our ships will not save you.”
			“Rubin, can we pinpoint where Swift Death is broadcasting from?” asked Monroe.
			Rubin shook her head. “I don’t know how to do that, sir.”
			“You have no weapons,” Swift Death continued. “This is your final chance to surrender. Turn over the Pufferfish and I promise you and your crew several additional hours of life.”
			Monroe studied the incoming ships. Swift Death was new to this assignment and needed to prove herself. A cautious attacker would hold back and let their missiles soften up the Pufferfish.
			But Swift Death had been an aggressive checkers player. She’d want an impressive victory, and that meant getting nice and close.
			“They’re warming up energy weapons,” said Grom.
			“They know we’re unarmed.” Monroe tagged the three central ships. “Grom, Johnny, you have your targets.”
			Grom maneuvered A-ring one, while Johnny launched a fifth ring, this one designated one-beta. She expanded one-beta to eighty percent of its maximum diameter, then nudged the grav beams, sending it forward.
			“Is this actually going to work?” asked Grom.
			Johnny shrugged a tentacle and spun up one-beta to three percent power. “Fuck if I know.”
			The first round of Prodryan fire crackled over the Pufferfish’s hull.
			“Time to find out.” Monroe watched the smaller ring move closer and closer to the larger, active ring, like one checker placed atop another. “King me.”
			Ring one-beta passed through ring one. The larger ring instantly accelerated the smaller, launching it at a modest twenty percent of light speed toward the first of the incoming fighters.
			In theory, according to Johnny’s calculations, one-beta should have then accelerated the fighter away from the Pufferfish at that same 0.2c speed.
			Instead, the fighter vanished in an explosion that sent a circle of debris slamming into the other two ships in its formation. A-ring one destabilized and exploded seconds later.
			Monroe blinked. “What just happened?”
			“I believe one-beta was half a degree off course,” said Johnny. “It may have caught on the fighter instead of passing cleanly around it. It accelerated half of the ship into the other half.”
			“Good enough for me. How soon can we launch two-beta?”
			Grom checked their screen. “The remaining fighters are veering away. We have a window to strike before they send reinforcements.”

Did they fight like true Prodryans? No. They ran away. They abandoned one of our greatest heroes. They created a blockade around the planet and worked to bury the truth like scavengers covering their pellets. Because of this criminal neglect, the crew of the Pufferfish was able to procure a sample of this biological weapon of mass destruction, one which would turn all Prodryans from predators to prey.”
			“Perhaps our new Supreme War Leader was ignorant of the danger of Hell’s Claws,” said Starfallen. “Or perhaps he was content to continue the policies of the past, to cower like a hatchling in a thunderstorm.”

As an all-round structural material it is unmatched. It is lighter than water, yet weight for weight is as stiff, strong, and tough as steel and can resist both being stretched and compressed. It is easy to shape, as it readily splits along the grain, and is soft enough to carve, especially when green. It can be found in pieces large enough to hold up houses, yet can be cut up into tools as small as a toothpick. It can last for centuries if it is kept permanently dry or wet, yet it can also be burned to keep us warm, to cook our food, and drive a wide range of industrial processes.

His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. “What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.”
“That’s not her fault,” I say.
“No, it’s no one’s fault. Just the way it is,” says Gale.
Madge’s face has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries in my hand. “Good luck, Katniss.”
“You, too,” I say, and the door closes.
We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don’t like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but he’s right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. That’s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem.
But here’s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year’s supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times.
You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madge’s family, it’s hard not to resent those who don’t have to sign up for tesserae.
Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, I’ve listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. “It’s to the Capitol’s advantage to have us divided among ourselves,” he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn’t reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I’m sure she thought was a harmless comment.

I’d seen him at school. He was in my year, but I didn’t know his name. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that I’d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home,

He didn’t even know me. Still, just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered. I couldn’t explain his actions.
We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends and didn’t acknowledge me in any way.

I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive.

It’s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything.

For the first time, I get a good look at it. It’s as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A mockingjay.
They’re funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations
 , or sometimes mutts
 for short. One was a special bird called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitol’s enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they’d fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.
Only they didn’t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated with female mockingbirds, creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a child’s high-pitched warble to a man’s deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.
My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, they’d always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, there’s something comforting about the little bird. It’s like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees.

A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there’s more to come. But I’m stuffing myself because I’ve never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds.
“At least, you two have decent manners,” says Effie as we’re finishing the main course. “The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion.”
The pair last year were two kids from the Seam who’d never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peeta’s a baker’s son. My mother taught Prim and me to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie Trinket’s comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together.
Now that the meal’s over, I’m fighting to keep the food down. I can see Peeta’s looking a little green, too. Neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down Greasy Sae’s concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree bark — a winter specialty — I’m determined to hang on to this."

“Yes,” hisses Effie Trinket. “How odd you two find it amusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death!”"

I can’t help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by the state he’s in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow.
“All right,” I say. “I can send one of the Capitol people to help you.” There’s any number on the train. Cooking for us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job.
“No. I don’t want them,” says Peeta.
I nod and head to my own room. I understand how Peeta feels. I can’t stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge. So I’m pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, It’s because he’s being kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread.

The idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there. And I can’t let Peeta do this. Not where we’re going. So I decide, from this moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the baker’s son.

I quickly open the window, toss the cookies Peeta’s father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of them.
Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it’s enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago . . .
I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark’s bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn’t lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and Prim’s hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After we’d harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we’d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread.
“What else?” Prim asked me. “What other food can we find?”
“All kinds of things,” I promised her. “I just have to remember them.”
My mother had a book she’d brought with her from the apothecary shop. The pages were made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages.
The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence. It was the first time I’d been there alone, without my father’s weapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow and arrows he’d made me from a hollow tree. I probably didn’t go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit. I’d shot a few rabbits before, with my father’s guidance. But this I’d done on my own.
We hadn’t had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl.
The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and you’re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested with my father’s pictures. I kept us alive.

On the eighth of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldn’t stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn’t absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter who’d shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasn’t around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries.

Tall with leaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don’t look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. “Katniss,” I said aloud. It’s the plant I was named for. And I heard my father’s voice joking, “As long as you can find yourself, you’ll never starve.” I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. That night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were all, for the first time in months, full.
Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing.
Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn’t trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing was ever the same between us again.
Now I was going to die without that ever being set right. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would all balance out."

When my stomach feels like it’s about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn’t paid much attention to his platter, but he’s knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it’s some kind of spirit. I don’t know Haymitch, but I’ve seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. He’ll be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol.
I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. It isn’t just that we’ve been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and he’s a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes — either because they’re betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner — expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with.
“So, you’re supposed to give us advice,” I say to Haymitch.
“Here’s some advice. Stay alive,” says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I’m having nothing more to do with him. I’m surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild.
“That’s very funny,” says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitch’s hand. It shatters on the floor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. “Only not to us.”
Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesn’t come. Instead he sits back and squints at us.
“Well, what’s this?” says Haymitch. “Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?”
Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw.
“No,” says Haymitch, stopping him. “Let the bruise show. The audience will think you’ve mixed it up with another tribute before you’ve even made it to the arena.”
“That’s against the rules,” says Peeta.
“Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you weren’t caught, even better,” says Haymitch"

Peeta and I don’t question this. The Hunger Games aren’t a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors.
“All right, I’ll make a deal with you. You don’t interfere with my drinking, and I’ll stay sober enough to help you,” says Haymitch. “But you have to do exactly what I say.”
It’s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all.
“Fine,” says Peeta.
“So help us,” I say. “When we get to the arena, what’s the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone —”

My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips.

Goat’s milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I’d have to get wild onions from the woods.

It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. “What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?” I say, looking up at the girl. “That’s the last thing I wa — oh! I know you!”
I can’t place a name or time to the girl’s face. But I’m certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I can’t pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table.
When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox?” snaps Effie. “The very thought.”
“What’s an Avox?” I ask stupidly.
“Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she can’t speak,” says Haymitch. “She’s probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you’d know her.”
“And even if you did, you’re not to speak to one of them unless it’s to give an order,” says Effie. “Of course, you don’t really know her.”
But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor
 I remember from where. The disapproval is so high I could never admit it. “No, I guess not, I just —” I stammer, and the wine is not helping.
Peeta snaps his fingers. “Delly Cartwright. That’s who it is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she’s a dead ringer for Delly.”
Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet — she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on Peeta’s suggestion gratefully. “Of course, that’s who I was thinking of. It must be the hair,” I say.
“Something about the eyes, too,” says Peeta.
The energy at the table relaxes. “Oh, well. If that’s all it is,” says Cinna. “And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.”
We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies that’s being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an “Ahh!” as they show us coming out of the Remake Center.
“Whose idea was the hand holding?” asks Haymitch.
“Cinna’s,” says Portia.
“Just the perfect touch of rebellion,” says Haymitch. “Very nice.”
Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes.
“Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and I’ll tell you exactly how I want you to play it,” says Haymitch to Peeta and"

When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him. “So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike here.”
He’s asking for an explanation, and I’m tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldn’t do me much harm. It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright.
I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but it’s unlikely I’ll ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I don’t see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend.
Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why I’m here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer.
To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there.
Peeta picks up on my hesitation. “Have you been on the roof yet?” I shake my head. “Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The wind’s a bit loud, though.”
I translate this into “No one will overhear us talking” in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. “"

On the other side of the dome, they’ve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, it’s enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly.
I pretend to examine a blossom. “We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,” I whisper.
“You and your father?” he whispers back.
“No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. I’m sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it,” I say.
For a moment I’m silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we’d moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but we’re both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched.
“The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,” I continue to Peeta. “I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didn’t make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But I’m certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy’s name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened.”
“Did they see you?” Peeta asked.
“I don’t know. We were under a shelf of rock,” I reply. But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She’d locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had responded.
“You’re shivering,” says Peeta.
The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?
Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right?

It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He laughs. “I’d go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, the food’s prime.”

Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after watching him lie so smoothly, I don’t give this much weight. “Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.”
The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta’s house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room.
“He knew your mother when they were kids,” says Peeta.
Another surprise. But probably true. “Oh, yes. She grew up in town,” I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread."

“Oh, sorry,” I say. “I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. I’m sorry. Can you take them to him?”
She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door.
I’d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know that my apology runs much deeper. That I’m ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger.
Just like I was watching the Games.
I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasn’t stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn’t even remember me. But I know she does.

Decide now.”
“Why would you coach us separately?” I ask.
“Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about,” says Haymitch.
I exchange a look with Peeta. “I don’t have any secret skills,” he says. “And I already know what yours is, right? I mean, I’ve eaten enough of your squirrels.”
I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse.

“Sorry, I don’t. Katniss. I already know you’re handy with a knife,” says Haymitch.
“Not really. But I can hunt,” I say. “With a bow and arrow.”
“And you’re good?” asks Haymitch.
I have to think about it. I’ve been putting food on the table for four years. That’s no small task. I’m not as good as my father was, but he’d had more practice. I’ve better aim than Gale, but I’ve had more practice. He’s a genius with traps and snares. “I’m all right,” I say.
“She’s excellent,” says Peeta. “My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. It’s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.”
This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he’s talking me up. “What are you doing?” I ask him suspiciously.
“What are you doing? If he’s going to help you, he has to know what you’re capable of. Don’t underrate yourself,” says Peeta.
I don’t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. “What about you? I’ve seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour,” I snap at him. “Tell him that. That’s not nothing.”
“Yes, and I’m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. It’s not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isn’t,” he shoots back.
“He can wrestle,” I tell Haymitch. “He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother.”
“What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death?” says Peeta in disgust.
“There’s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and you’ll at least stand a chance. If I get jumped, I’m dead!” I can hear my voice rising in anger.
“But you won’t! You’ll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows.

“Oh, she meant you,” I say with a wave of dismissal.
“She said, ‘She’s a survivor, that one.’ She
 is,” says Peeta.
That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta’s eyes and know he isn’t lying.
Suddenly I’m behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when I speak. “But only because someone helped me.”
Peeta’s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. “People will help you in the arena. They’ll be tripping over each other to sponsor you.”
“No more than you,” I say.
Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. “She has no idea. The effect she can have.” He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me."

No one pitied me!
I glower at the roll, sure he meant to insult me.
After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, “Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, there’s no guarantee there’ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?”
“I know a few basic snares,” I mutter.
“That may be significant in terms of food,” says Haymitch. “And, Peeta, she’s right, never underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don’t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plan’s the same for both of you. You go to group training.

You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family’s resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I’m thin, I’m strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.
The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. It’s technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them.
The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition.

“Right you are,” says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger Games hot spot.

We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage.

He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. They’re for birthdays and New Year’s Day.

I look more critically at the design on Peeta’s arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt he’s ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing — his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert — annoys me.

Somehow, although it’s made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home.

There’s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I’ve been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I can’t even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There’s a shooting range, but it’s much too limited. Standard bull’s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The string’s tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow’s more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, I’m humiliated, then I head back to the bull’s-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons.
Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture.
It’s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.
Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don’t even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I’m being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers’ table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig’s mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.

The words are sinking in. My anger fading. I’m torn now between thinking I’ve been used and thinking I’ve been given an edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress. Giggling. The only moment of any substance I had was when I talked about Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and I’m forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in training.

I’m actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that’s transported by one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment.

For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all.

“Move,” I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath. While I’ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I’m guaranteed a close-up.
The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, I’d better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened.
No, I need to look one step ahead of the game.
So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that means!
I’m about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it’s imprudent to check them with the others so close. But I have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible meat. I’m rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I’ve cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. I’m wishing for a fire — eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way — when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals.

They’re bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt, but they’re also heavier. There’s a reason it’s me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests.

I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree — a possum maybe — catching the firelight from the Careers’ torches. Suddenly, I’m up on one elbow. Those are no possum’s eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not animal eyes at all.

How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly before I did, hearing the pack was so close.
For a while we hold each other’s gaze. Then, without even rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and points to something above my head.




My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, I have no idea what she’s pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of . . . of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. There’s something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then I know. It’s a wasp nest.
Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still. After all, I don’t know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we’ll-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn’t the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol’s muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts"

I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan.

In the faint light of the Careers’ torches, I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise I’ve ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that it’s medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes.
“Oh, Haymitch,” I whisper. “Thank you.” He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless.
I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, it’s high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol’s labs. When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it’s all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.
A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine"

I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with.
The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures.

I try splashing myself but eventually just lie down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers.

My mother would use other methods, but it’s not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee.
“Ohhh.” The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it. It’s as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting.
Rue gives a giggle. “Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or you’d be a lot worse.”
“Do my neck! Do my cheek!” I almost beg.
Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon I’m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn on Rue’s forearm. “I’ve got something for that.” I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine.
“You have good sponsors,” she says longingly.
“Have you gotten anything yet?” I ask. She shakes her head. “You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are.” I turn the meat over.
“You weren’t joking, about wanting me for an ally?” she asks.
“No, I meant it,” I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because she’s a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim.
“Okay,” she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. “It’s a deal.”
Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that."

Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For a while, all conversation stops as we fill our stomachs. The groosling has delicious meat that’s so fatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite into it.
“Oh,” says Rue with a sigh. “I’ve never had a whole leg to myself before.”
I’ll bet she hasn’t. I’ll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. “Take the other,” I say.
“Really?” she asks.
“Take whatever you want. Now that I’ve got a bow and arrows, I can get more. Plus I’ve got snares. I can show you how to set them,” I say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. “Oh, take it,” I say, putting the drumstick in her hands. “It will only keep a few days anyway, and we’ve got the whole bird plus the rabbit.” Once she’s got hold of it, her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful."

She’s seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. She’s gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries.
I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. “You sure this is safe?”
“Oh, yes, we have them back home. I’ve been eating them for days,” she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it’s as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case we’re separated, we’ll both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. “I know it’s not much,” she says as if embarrassed, “but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast.”
“You did just right,” I say. When I spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses.
“How did you get those?” she asks.
“In my pack. They’ve been useless so far. They don’t block the sun and they make it harder to see,” I say with a shrug.
“These aren’t for sun, they’re for darkness,” exclaims Rue. “Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, they’ll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the torchlight doesn’t reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot.”
“They killed a boy for taking these?” I say.
“Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasn’t right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play with,” says Rue.
Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but I can’t imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. There’s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae’s grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. She’s not quite right, but she’s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things.

I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our fire and head upstream until it’s almost nightfall.
“Where do you sleep?” I ask her. “In the trees?” She nods. “In just your jacket?”
Rue holds up her extra pair of socks. “I have these for my hands.”
I think of how cold the nights have been. “You can share my sleeping bag if you want. We’ll both easily fit.” Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for.
We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today.
“Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss?” The anthem should block out our words, but still I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. I don’t want the audience to know what I’m planning to tell her about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same.

I don’t answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I’m in his debt again. And this can’t be paid back. “If he did, it was all probably just part of his act. You know, to make people think he’s in love with me.”
“Oh,” says Rue thoughtfully. “I didn’t think that was an act.”
“Course it is,” I say. “He worked it out with our mentor.” The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. “Let’s try out these glasses.” I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasn’t kidding. I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. I could kill it from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone.
“I wonder who else got a pair of these,” I say.
“The Careers have two pairs. But they’ve got everything down by the lake,” Rue says. “And they’re so strong.”

“You are. You can shoot,” she says. “What can I do?”
“You can feed yourself. Can they?” I ask.
“They don’t need to. They have all those supplies,” Rue says.
“Say they didn’t. Say the supplies were gone. How long would they last?” I say. “I mean, it’s the Hunger Games, right?”
“But, Katniss, they’re not hungry,” says Rue.
“No, they’re not. That’s the problem,” I agree. And for the first time, I have a plan. A plan that isn’t motivated by the need for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. “I think we’re going to have to fix that, Rue.”

In fact, I’m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it’s Rue, but then I recognize Foxface — she’s the one we couldn’t remember this morning — creeping out onto the plain. When she decides it’s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. In a moment, she’s regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.
So, I’m right about the booby trap, but it’s clearly more complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then she’s doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound.
I realize I’m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what I’d already guessed. But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? You’d have thought . . . and slowly it begins to dawn on me . . . you’d have thought the very ground was going to explode.
“It’s mined,” I whisper. That explains everything. The Careers’ willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface’s reaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies? That’s not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. I "

It’s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3.
The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead

When I break into the clearing, she’s on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body.




The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I’m reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, “Are there more? Are there more?”
She has to say no several times before I hear it.
Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it’s far beyond my capacity to heal. Beyond anyone’s probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There’s no point in comforting words, in telling her she’ll be all right. She’s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline. As if it’s me who’s dying instead of Rue.
“You blew up the food?” she whispers.

“You have to win,” she says.
“I’m going to. Going to win for both of us now,” I promise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District 1.

 I think. Sing what?

Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and fatigue. But if this is Prim’s, I mean, Rue’s last request, I have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with. It’s old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.

Then I remember Peeta’s words on the roof. “Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capitol they don’t own me. That I’m more than just a piece in their Games.
 ” And for the first time, I understand what he means.
I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they can’t own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I.
A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful and come back to Rue’s side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors.
They’ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, they’ll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all.
“Bye, Rue,” I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction. Then I walk away without looking back.
The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don’t know how it knows. It must hear things that humans can’t. I pause, my eyes focused on what’s ahead, not what’s happening behind me. It doesn’t take long, then the general birdsong begins again and I know she’s gone.
Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue’s melody. My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean she’s safe.
“Good and safe,” I say as I pass under its branch. “We don’t have to worry about her now.” Good and safe.
I’ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. I’m not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except I’d kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands.

A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs I’ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. There’s a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although she’s lost in the leaves. When I fully awaken, I’m momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.
Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if there’s liquid lead in my veins. I’ve lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it’s the thought of Prim’s anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy.
I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like “Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water, Katniss.” I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. “Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss.”
Rue’s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly you’ll be home before you’re hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing.
Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue’s roots and nuts, the boy’s dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss,

For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there’s nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for. I wouldn’t go in for the food, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors.

“You here to finish me off, sweetheart?”
I whip around. It’s come from the left, so I can’t pick it up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but there’s nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks.
“Peeta?” I whisper. “Where are you?” There’s no answer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I’m certain it was real and very close at hand, too. “Peeta?” I creep along the bank.
“Well, don’t step on me.”
I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still there’s nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs.
It’s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank full of weeds.
“Close your eyes again,” I order. He does, and his mouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. “I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.”
Peeta smiles. “Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying.”
“You’re not going to die,” I tell him firmly.
“Says who?” His voice is so ragged.
“Says me. We’re on the same team now, you know,” I tell him.
His eyes open. “So, I heard. Nice of you to find what’s left of me.”
I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. “Did Cato cut you?” I ask.
“Left leg. Up high,” he answers.
“Let’s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds you’ve got,” I say.
“Lean down a minute first,” he says. “Need to tell you something.” I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle as he whispers. “Remember, we’re madly in love, so it’s all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”
I jerk my head back but end up laughing. “Thanks, I’ll keep it in mind.”"

This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that he’s burning with fever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail.
“Swallow these,” I tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. “You must be hungry.”
“Not really. It’s funny, I haven’t been hungry for days,” says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That’s when I know how sick he is.
“Peeta, we need to get some food in you,” I insist.
“It’ll just come right back up,” he says. The best I can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. “Thanks. I’m much better, really. Can I sleep now, Katniss?” he asks.
“Soon,” I promise. “I need to look at your leg first.” Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Cato’s sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst of all, the smell of festering flesh.
I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face. But there’s no one here but me. I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases.
“Pretty awful, huh?” says Peeta. He’s watching me closely.
“So-so.” I shrug like it’s no big deal. “You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines.” I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever she’s treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I don’t even much like to be around coughing. “First thing is to clean it well.”
I’ve left on Peeta’s undershorts because they’re not in bad shape and I don’t want to pull them over the swollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable. That’s another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause for embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly. But the gash on his leg . . . what on earth can I do for that?

I know the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I start with those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance.
“Katniss?” Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. “How about that kiss?”
I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I can’t stand it.
“Something wrong?” he asks a little too innocently.
“I . . . I’m no good at this. I’m not my mother. I’ve no idea what I’m doing and I hate pus,” I say. “Euh!” I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second. “Euuuh!”
“How do you hunt?” he asks.
“Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this,” I said. “Although for all I know, I am killing you.”
“Can you speed it up a little?” he asks.
“No. Shut up and eat your pears,” I say.
After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has gone down, I can see how deep Cato’s sword cut. Right down to the bone."

“You’re just like the rest of my family,” I say. “I care, all right?” I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw.
“You know, you’re kind of squeamish for such a lethal person,” says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks. “I wish I’d let you give Haymitch a shower after all.”

“You would have found me if you could,” I say. His forehead’s burning up. Like the medicine’s having no effect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I’m scared he’s going to die.
“Yes. Look, if I don’t make it back —” he begins.
“Don’t talk like that. I didn’t drain all that pus for nothing,” I say.
“I know. But just in case I don’t —” he tries to continue.
“No, Peeta, I don’t even want to discuss it,” I say, placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him.
“But I —” he insists.
Impulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his words. This is probably overdue anyway since he’s right, we are supposed to be madly in love.

“All right,” he whispers.
I step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peeta’s leg. Instead I find a pot of hot broth.
Haymitch couldn’t be sending me a clearer message. One kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his snarl. “You’re supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boy’s dying. Give me something I can work with!”
And he’s right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I’ve got to give the audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one. Romance.
Never having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. I think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my mother’s face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died.
“Peeta!” I say, trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father. He’s dozed off again, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if he’d be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. He’s great at this stuff.
I hold up the pot. “Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.”




Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night.

Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came after him. I’m just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.
When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on Peeta’s lip and discover the fever has broken. He’s not back to normal, but it’s come down a few degrees. Last night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue’s berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.
Peeta’s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. “I woke up and you were gone,” he says. “I was worried about you.”
I have to laugh as I ease him back down. “You were worried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately?”
“I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like to hunt at night,” he says, still serious.

I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch.
“No more kisses for you until you’ve eaten,” I say.
We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I feed him. He refuses the groosling again, though.
“You didn’t sleep,” Peeta says.
“I’m all right,” I say. But the truth is, I’m exhausted.
“Sleep now. I’ll keep watch. I’ll wake you if anything happens,” he says. I hesitate. “Katniss, you can’t stay up forever.”
He’s got a point there. I’ll have to sleep eventually. And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side. “All right,” I say. “But just for a few hours. Then you wake me.”
It’s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment’s notice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. “Go to sleep,” he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don’t want him to stop and he doesn’t. He’s still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.
Too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open my eyes that we’re into the afternoon. Peeta’s right beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive but better rested than I’ve been in days.
“Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours,” I say.
“For what? Nothing’s going on here,” he says. “Besides I like watching you sleep. You don’t scowl. Improves your looks a lot.”
This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. That’s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he’s been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap the leg."

I can’t imagine the cost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning.
“Well, there’s more swelling, but the pus is gone,” I say in an unsteady voice.

That can’t hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prim’s birthday.
Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my eye. There’s an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. I don’t know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and he’s got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But he’s lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He’s filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it.
One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew someone who could fix it.
“Gale,” I whispered. “I want that goat for Prim.”
Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadow’s a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It’s not even against the law.
“She’s hurt pretty bad,” said Gale. “We better take a closer look.”
We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious.
“Let her be,” said the man.
“Just looking,” said Gale.
“Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,” said the man.
“What’s the butcher giving for her?” I asked.
The man shrugged. “Hang around and see.” I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. “Lucky thing you showed up,” said the Goat Man when she arrived. “Girl’s got her eye on your goat.”
“Not if she’s spoken for,” I said carelessly.
Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. “She’s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.”
“What?” said the Goat Man. “We had a deal.”
“We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not that thing. Sell her to the girl if she’s stupid enough to take her,” said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink.
The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goat off his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; I’d been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat.
Gale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look on Prim’s face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house.
You should have seen Prim’s reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animal’s throat.
“They sound like you,” says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he was there.
“Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn’t have died if it tried,” I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands.
“Don’t worry. I’m not trying,” he jokes. “Finish the story.”
“Well, that’s it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something,” I say. “It was already mad about her.”
“Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?” he asks.
“I think so,” I say. “Why?”
“I’m just trying to get a picture,” he says thoughtfully. “I can see why that day made you happy.”
“Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,” I say.
“Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping,” says Peeta drily.
“The goat has
 paid for itself. Several times over,” I say in a superior tone.
“Well, it wouldn’t dare do anything else after you saved its life,” says Peeta. “I intend to do the same thing.”
“Really? What did you cost me again?” I ask."

The sound of the trumpets startles me. I’m on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable. It’s my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I expected, he’s inviting us to a feast. Well, we’re not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says, “Now hold on. Some of you may already be declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs something desperately.”
I do need something desperately. Something to heal Peeta’s leg.
“Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be your last chance,” says Claudius.
There’s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. “No,” he says. “You’re not risking your life for me.”
“Who said I was?” I say.
“So, you’re not going?” he asks.
“Of course, I’m not going. Give me some credit. Do you think I’m running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don’t be stupid,” I say, helping him back to bed. “I’ll let them fight it out, we’ll see who’s in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there.”

He’s gotten the medicine — I don’t know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels — and I can save Peeta! It’s such a tiny vial though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There’s no question, it’s sleep syrup. It’s a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone’s had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? I’m so furious I’m about to throw Haymitch’s last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? That’s more than I need.
I mash up a handful of berries so the taste won’t be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I head back up to the cave. “I’ve brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream.”
Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. “They’re very sweet.”
“Yes, they’re sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Haven’t you ever had them before?” I say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth.
“No,” he says, almost puzzled. “But they taste familiar. Sugar berries?”
“Well, you can’t get them in the market much, they only grow wild,” I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more to go.
“They’re sweet as syrup,” he says, taking the last spoonful. “Syrup.” His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but it’s too late, he’s already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what I’ve done is unforgivable.
I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away. “Who can’t lie, Peeta?” I say, even though he can’t hear me.

I don’t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin.
“Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather’s not helping much,” he says. There’s a clap of thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head and upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rocks above me.
“I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who’s the target?” says Peeta."

But there are things you don’t question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything.

I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn’t know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It’s not the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, I’ve got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand.
“Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out,” I say mischievously.
“Yeah, about that,” says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. “Don’t try something like that again.”
“Or what?” I ask.
“Or . . . or . . .” He can’t think of anything good. “Just give me a minute.”
“What’s the problem?” I say with a grin.
“The problem is we’re both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,” says Peeta.
“I did do the right thing,” I say.
“No! Just don’t, Katniss!” His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and there’s real anger in his voice. “Don’t die for me. You won’t be doing me any favors. All right?”
I’m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. “Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren’t the only one who . . . who worries about . . . what it would be like if . . .”
I fumble. I’m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I don’t want him to die. And it’s not about the sponsors. And it’s not about what will happen back home. And it’s not just that I don’t want to be alone. It’s him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread.
“If what, Katniss?” he says softly.
I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever I’m feeling, it’s no one’s business but mine.
“That’s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of,” I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. In fact, he’s probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it.
“Then I’ll just have to fill in the blanks myself,” he says, and moves in to me.
This is the first kiss that we’re both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another."

The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. I’m rotten at it, but Peeta’s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking.
“Peeta,” I say lightly. “You said at the interview you’d had a crush on me forever. When did forever start?”
“Oh, let’s see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . it was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up,” Peeta says.
“Your father? Why?” I ask.
“He said, ‘See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner,’” Peeta says.
“What? You’re making that up!” I exclaim.
“No, true story,” Peeta says. “And I said, ‘A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she could’ve had you?’ And he said, ‘Because when he sings . . . even the birds stop to listen.’”
“That’s true. They do. I mean, they did,” I say. I’m stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think it’s a waste of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father.
“So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent,” Peeta says.
“Oh, please,” I say, laughing.
“No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew — just like your mother — I was a goner,” Peeta says. “Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you.”
“Without success,” I add.
“Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck,” says Peeta."

Because we’re supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love, not actually being in love. But Peeta’s story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although I don’t remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . there was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my father’s death.
It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true . . . could it all be true?
“You have a . . . remarkable memory,” I say haltingly.
“I remember everything about you,” says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. “You’re the one who wasn’t paying attention.”
“I am now,” I say.
“Well, I don’t have much competition here,” he says.
I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I know I can’t. It’s as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, “Say it! Say it!”
I swallow hard and get the words out. “You don’t have much competition anywhere.” And this time, it’s me who leans in.
Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but there’s no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, he’s out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there’s a feast — fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer.
Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. “I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.”
“I guess so,” I answer.
But in my head I can hear Haymitch’s smug, if slightly exasperated, words, “Yes, that’s
 what I’m looking for, sweetheart.”

“Ah, that’ll be nice,” says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. “You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games tales.”
“I told you, he hates me!” I say, but I can’t help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal.
“Only sometimes. When he’s sober, I’ve never heard him say one negative thing about you,” says Peeta.
“He’s never sober!” I protest.
“That’s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It’s Cinna who likes you. But that’s mainly because you didn’t try to run when he set you on fire,” says Peeta. “On the other hand, Haymitch . . . well, if I were you, I’d avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.”
“I thought you said I was his favorite,” I say.
“He hates me more,” says Peeta. “I don’t think people in general are his sort of thing.”
I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch’s expense. He has been around so long, he’s practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, they’ll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he’s made up. He’s at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he’s holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive.
It’s funny. Haymitch and I don’t get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn’t something to ease Peeta’s pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasn’t made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I’ll see the strings attached to it.
A thought hits me, and I’m amazed the question’s taken so long to surface. Maybe it’s because I’ve only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. “How do you think he did it?”
“Who? Did what?” Peeta asks.
“Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?” I say.
Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He’s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he’s so surly, it’s hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There’s only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as I’m reaching this conclusion myself.
“He outsmarted the others,” says Peeta.
I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I’m wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn’t always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.

“Hey, Effie, watch this!” says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, “We miss you, Effie!”

Ideally, I’d dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then he’d be left with only a knife to defend himself against Cato’s spears and superior strength. So what I’d really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn’t going to go for that suggestion.

Surprisingly, he just laughs. “Look, I can handle Cato. I fought him before, didn’t I?”
Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That’s what I want to say, but I can’t. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. “What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted?” I say, trying to make it sound like very important work.
“What if you show me what’s edible around here and go get us some meat?” he says, mimicking my tone. “Just don’t go far, in case you need help.”

The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he?
“Peeta!” I call out in a panic. “Peeta!” I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage.
My fear comes out as anger. “What are you doing? You’re supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!”
“I found some berries down by the stream,” he says, clearly confused by my outburst.
“I whistled. Why didn’t you whistle back?” I snap at him.

The rolls and apples are untouched, but someone’s definitely picked away part of the cheese. “And you ate without me!” I really don’t care, I just want something else to be mad about.
“What? No, I didn’t,” Peeta says.
“Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,” I say.
“I don’t know what ate the cheese,” Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, “but it wasn’t me. I’ve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some?”
I would actually, but I don’t want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. I’ve never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren’t Rue’s berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers.
My father’s voice comes back to me. “Not these, Katniss. Never these. They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they reach your stomach.”
Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What’s left of Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.
I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese. . . .

As they join together, they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. There’s something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can’t put my finger on it.
They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine I’ve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number 1

Peeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water.

“Do it. Before they send those mutts back or something. I don’t want to die like Cato,” he says.
“Then you shoot me,” I say furiously, shoving the weapons back at him. “You shoot me and go home and live with it!” And as I say it, I know death right here, right now would be the easier of the two.
“You know I can’t,” Peeta says, discarding the weapons. “Fine, I’ll go first anyway.” He leans down and rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth.
“No, you can’t kill yourself,” I say. I’m on my knees, desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound.
“Katniss,” he says. “It’s what I want.”
“You’re not leaving me here alone,” I say. Because if he dies, I’ll never go home, not really. I’ll spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out.
“Listen,” he says, pulling me to my feet. “We both know they have to have a victor. It can only be one of us. Please, take it. For me.” And he goes on about how he loves me, what life would be without me but I’ve stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately around.

We both know they have to have a victor.

Yes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers’ faces. They’d have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country.

My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. “No, I won’t let you.”
“Trust me,” I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. “On the count of three?”
Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. “The count of three,” he says.
We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight.
“Hold them out. I want everyone to see,” he says.
I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta’s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. “One.” Maybe I’m wrong. “Two.” Maybe they don’t care if we both die. “Three!” It’s too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare.
The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. “Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you — the tributes of District Twelve!”

And since my eyes were looking down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta’s leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious.

Doctors in sterile white, masked and gloved, already prepped to operate, go into action.

The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I’m afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. “Did Peeta make it?” She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship.
I guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment here. Still, I hadn’t been sure until now.
As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it?

Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but I don’t care. I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitch’s arms first. When he whispers in my ear, “Nice job, sweetheart,” it doesn’t sound sarcastic. Effie’s somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn’t say anything.

“Have you given up the whole ‘girl on fire’ thing?” I ask.
“You tell me,” he says, and slips it over my head. I immediately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and I frown.
“I know,” says Cinna before I can object. “But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise.” He stops me before I can look at my reflection. “Wait, don’t forget the shoes.” Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn to the mirror.
I am still the “girl on fire.” The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight.
“What do you think?” asks Cinna.
“I think it’s the best yet,” I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, I’m in for something of a shock. My hair’s loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent. Harmless.

This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation.

Okay, that’s an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put my arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing his lips.
“Listen up. You’re in trouble. Word is the Capitol’s furious about you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they can’t stand is being laughed at and they’re the joke of Panem,” says Haymitch.

So I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol. But the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if they’ve been in control the whole time.

It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because it’s better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover.

This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I can’t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. “I don’t know, I just . . . couldn’t bear the thought of . . . being without him.”

Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. “Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone. We should be okay.” I watch him head back to the train, avoiding Peeta’s eyes.
“What’s he mean?” Peeta asks me.
“It’s the Capitol. They didn’t like our stunt with the berries,” I blurt out.
“What? What are you talking about?” he says.
“It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days. So I didn’t make it worse,” I say.
“Coaching you? But not me,” says Peeta.
“He knew you were smart enough to get it right,” I say.
“I didn’t know there was anything to get right,” says Peeta. “So, what you’re saying is, these last few days and then I guess . . . back in the arena . . . that was just some strategy you two worked out.”
“No. I mean, I couldn’t even talk to him in the arena, could I?” I stammer.
“But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn’t you?” says Peeta. I bite my lip. “Katniss?” He drops my hand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance.
“It was all for the Games,” Peeta says. “How you acted.”
“Not all of it,” I say, tightly holding on to my flowers.
“Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question is what’s going to be left when we get home?” he says.
“I don’t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,” I say. He waits, for further explanation, but none’s forthcoming.
“Well, let me know when you work it out,” he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable.
I know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train. By the time I’ve climbed aboard, Peeta has disappeared into his room for the night. I don’t see him the next morning, either. In fact, the next time he turns up, we’re pulling into District 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless.
I want to tell him that he’s not being fair. That we were strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That I can’t explain how things are with Gale because I don’t know myself. That it’s no good loving me because I’m never going to get married anyway and he’d just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings for him, it doesn’t matter because I’ll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what we’ve just been through?
I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But that wouldn’t be fair on my part.
So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the platform’s thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming.
Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure. “One more time? For the audience?” he says. His voice isn’t angry. It’s hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.
I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go."

The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well, leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day. Less than a week after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The mines weren’t an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in town. At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of the kids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up for tesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On top of that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn’t enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at the slightest provocation. Still would if it wasn’t for a salve my mother concocted.

Gale told me that Greasy Sae, the old woman who serves up soup, started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games. It was supposed to be just a Hob thing, but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in. I don’t know exactly how much it was, and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant. But for all I know, it made the difference between my life and death.
It’s still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag, with nothing to trade, and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip. I try to hit as many stalls as possible, spreading out my purchases of coffee, buns, eggs, yarn, and oil. As an afterthought, I buy three bottles of white liquor from a one-armed woman named Ripper, a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive.
The liquor isn’t for my family. It’s for Haymitch, who acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games. He’s surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he did his job—more than his job—because for the first time in history, two tributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. And that’s for always. I’m getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, it wasn’t much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I’ve been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there’s a shortage again.

Letting her handle all the money I won. Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them. My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn’t help, specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father’s death. Because sometimes things happen to people and they’re not equipped to deal with them.
Like me, for instance. Right now.
Besides, there’s one wonderful thing she did when I arrived back in the district. After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the train station, there were a few questions allowed from reporters. Someone asked my mother what she thought of my new boyfriend, and she replied that, while Peeta was the very model of what a young man should be, I wasn’t old enough to have any boyfriend at all. She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta. There was a lot of laughter and comments like “Somebody’s in trouble” from the press, and Peeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me. That didn’t last long—there was too much pressure to act otherwise—but it gave us an excuse to be a little more reserved than we’d been in the Capitol.

I may have no interest in designing clothes but I do love the ones Cinna makes for me. Like these. Flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. A comfortable white shirt. A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kitten-soft wool. Laced leather boots that don’t pinch my toes.

In the hallway outside my door, Haymitch gives my shoulder a pat and says, “You could do a lot worse, you know.” He heads off to his compartment, taking the smell of wine with him.
In my room, I remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. There are more in the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes. I stare into the darkness, thinking about my conversation with Haymitch. Everything he said was true about the Capitol’s expectations, my future with Peeta, even his last comment. Of course, I could do a lot worse than Peeta. That isn’t really the point, though, is it? One of the few freedoms we have in District 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. And now even that has been taken away from me. I wonder if President Snow will insist we have children. If we do, they’ll have to face the reaping each year. And wouldn’t it be something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena? Victors’ children have been in the ring before. It always causes a lot of excitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that family’s favor. But it happens too frequently to just be about odds. Gale’s convinced the Capitol does it on purpose, rigs the drawings to add extra drama. Given all the trouble I’ve caused, I’ve probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in the Games.
I think of Haymitch, unmarried, no family, blotting out the world with drink. He could have had his choice of any woman in the district. And he chose solitude. Not solitude—that sounds too peaceful. More like solitary confinement. Was it because, having been in the arena, he knew it was better than risking the alternative? I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prim’s name on reaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death. But as her sister I could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother.

The full impact of what he’s saying hits me. I will never have a life with Gale, even if I want to. I will never be allowed to live alone. I will have to be forever in love with Peeta. The Capitol will insist on it. I’ll have a few years maybe, because I’m still only sixteen, to stay with my mother and Prim. And then…and then…

The trees still wear green leaves. How far south have we come in a day? I walk along the track, squinting against the bright sunlight, already regretting my words to Effie. She’s hardly to blame for my current predicament. I should go back and apologize. My outburst was the height of bad manners, and manners matter deeply to her. But my feet continue on along the track, past the end of the train, leaving it behind. An hour’s delay. I can walk at least twenty minutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare. Instead, after a couple hundred yards, I sink to the ground and sit there, looking into the distance. If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going?

“It’s nothing,” I say.
He takes a deep breath. “Look, Katniss, I’ve been wanting to talk to you about the way I acted on the train. I mean, the last train. The one that brought us home. I knew you had something with Gale. I was jealous of him before I even officially met you. And it wasn’t fair to hold you to anything that happened in the Games. I’m sorry.”
His apology takes me by surprise. It’s true that Peeta froze me out after I confessed that my love for him during the Games was something of an act. But I don’t hold that against him. In the arena, I’d played that romance angle for all it was worth. There had been times when I didn’t honestly know how I felt about him. I still don’t, really.
“I’m sorry, too,” I say. I’m not sure for what exactly. Maybe because there’s a real chance I’m about to destroy him.
“There’s nothing for you to be sorry about. You were just keeping us alive. But I don’t want us to go on like this, ignoring each other in real life and falling into the snow every time there’s a camera around. So I thought if I stopped being so, you know, wounded, we could take a shot at just being friends,” he says.
All my friends are probably going to end up dead, but refusing Peeta wouldn’t keep him safe. “Okay,” I say. His offer does make me feel better. Less duplicitous somehow. It would be nice if he’d come to me with this earlier, before I knew that President Snow had other plans and just being friends was not an option for us anymore.

And then he hesitates before adding something that wasn’t written on the card. Maybe because he thought Effie might make him remove it. “It can in no way replace your losses, but as a token of our thanks we’d like for each of the tributes’ families from District Eleven to receive one month of our winnings every year for the duration of our lives.”
The crowd can’t help but respond with gasps and murmurs. There is no precedent for what Peeta has done. I don’t even know if it’s legal. He probably doesn’t know, either, so he didn’t ask in case it isn’t. As for the families, they just stare at us in shock. Their lives were changed forever when Thresh and Rue were lost, but this gift will change them again. A month of tribute winnings can easily provide for a family for a year.

I remember how I took care in the arena to cover her with flowers, to make sure her loss did not go unnoticed. But that gesture will mean nothing if I don’t support it now.

As far as I know, Haymitch has only been here once, when he was on his Victory Tour decades ago. But he must have a remarkable memory or reliable instincts, because he leads us up through a maze of twisting staircases and increasingly narrow halls. At times he has to stop and force a door. By the protesting squeak of the hinges you can tell it’s been a long time since it was opened. Eventually we climb a ladder to a trapdoor. When Haymitch pushes it aside, we find ourselves in the dome of the Justice Building. It’s a huge place filled with broken furniture, piles of books and ledgers, and rusty weapons. The coat of dust blanketing everything is so thick it’s clear it hasn’t been disturbed for years. Light struggles to filter in through four grimy square windows set in the sides of the dome. Haymitch kicks the trapdoor shut and turns on us.
“What happened?” he asks.
Peeta relates all that occurred in the square. The whistle, the salute, our hesitation on the verandah, the murder of the old man. “What’s going on, Haymitch?”
“It will be better coming from you,” Haymitch says to me.
I don’t agree. I think it will be a hundred times worse coming from me. But I tell Peeta everything as calmly as I can. About President Snow, the unrest in the districts. I don’t even omit the kiss with Gale. I lay out how we are all in jeopardy, how the whole country is in jeopardy because of my trick with the berries. “I was supposed to fix things on this tour. Make everyone who had doubted believe I acted out of love. Calm things down. But obviously, all I’ve done today is get three people killed, and now everyone in the square will be punished.” I feel so sick that I have to sit down on a couch, despite the exposed springs and stuffing.
“Then I made things worse, too. By giving the money,” says Peeta. Suddenly he strikes out at a lamp that sits precariously on a crate and knocks it across the room, where it shatters against the floor. “This has to stop. Right now. This—this—game you two play, where you tell each other secrets but keep them from me like I’m too inconsequential or stupid or weak to handle them.”
“It’s not like that, Peeta—” I begin.
“It’s exactly like that!” he yells at me. “I have people I care about, too, Katniss! Family and friends back in District Twelve who will be just as dead as yours if we don’t pull this thing off. So, after all we went through in the arena, don’t I even rate the truth from you?”

“Well, you overestimated me. Because I really screwed up today. What do you think is going to happen to Rue’s and Thresh’s families? Do you think they’ll get their share of our winnings? Do you think I gave them a bright future? Because I think they’ll be lucky if they survive the day!” Peeta sends something else flying, a statue. I’ve never seen him like this.
“He’s right, Haymitch,” I say. “We were wrong not to tell him. Even back in the Capitol.”
“Even in the arena, you two had some sort of system worked out, didn’t you?” asks Peeta. His voice is quieter now. “Something I wasn’t part of.”
“No. Not officially. I just could tell what Haymitch wanted me to do by what he sent, or didn’t send,” I say.
“Well, I never had that opportunity. Because he never sent me anything until you showed up,” says Peeta.
I haven’t thought much about this. How it must have looked from Peeta’s perspective when I appeared in the arena having received burn medicine and bread when he, who was at death’s door, had gotten nothing. Like Haymitch was keeping me alive at his expense.
“Look, boy—” Haymitch begins.
“Don’t bother, Haymitch. I know you had to choose one of us. And I’d have wanted it to be her. But this is something different. People are dead out there. More will follow unless we’re very good. We all know I’m better than Katniss in front of the cameras. No one needs to coach me on what to say. But I have to know what I’m walking into,” says Peeta.
“From now on, you’ll be fully informed,” Haymitch promises.
“I better be,” says Peeta. He doesn’t even bother to look at me before he leaves.
The dust he disrupted billows up and looks for new places to land. My hair, my eyes, my shiny gold pin.
“Did you choose me, Haymitch?” I ask.
“Yeah,” he says.
“Why? You like him better,” I say.
“That’s true. But remember, until they changed the rules, I could only hope to get one of you out of there alive,” he says. “I thought since he was determined to protect you, well, between the three of us, we might be able to bring you home.”
“Oh” is all I can think to say.
“You’ll see, the choices you’ll have to make. If we survive this,” says Haymitch. “You’ll learn.”
Well, I’ve learned one thing today. This place is not a larger version of District 12. Our fence is unguarded and rarely charged. Our Peacekeepers are unwelcome but less brutal. Our hardships evoke more fatigue than fury. Here in 11, they suffer more acutely and feel more desperation. President Snow is right. A spark could be enough to set them ablaze."

Surely, Haymitch hasn’t told her about what happened in the square. I wouldn’t be surprised if Cinna and Portia know, but there seems to be an unspoken agreement to leave Effie out of the bad-news loop. It doesn’t take long to hear about the problem, though.
Effie runs through the evening’s schedule, then tosses it aside. “And then, thank goodness, we can all get on that train and get out of here,” she says.
“Is something wrong, Effie?” asks Cinna.
“I don’t like the way we’ve been treated. Being stuffed into trucks and barred from the platform. And then, about an hour ago, I decided to look around the Justice Building. I’m something of an expert in architectural design, you know,” she says.
“Oh, yes, I’ve heard that,” says Portia before the pause gets too long.
“So, I was just having a peek around because district ruins are going to be all the rage this year, when two Peacemakers showed up and ordered me back to our quarters. One of them actually poked me with her gun!” says Effie.
I can’t help thinking this is the direct result of Haymitch, Peeta, and me disappearing earlier in the day. It’s a little reassuring, actually, to think that Haymitch might have been right. That no one would have been monitoring the dusty dome where we talked. Although I bet they are now.
Effie looks so distressed that I spontaneously give her a hug. “That’s awful, Effie. Maybe we shouldn’t go to the dinner at all. At least until they’ve apologized.” I know she’ll never agree to this, but she brightens considerably at the suggestion, at the validation of her complaint.
“No, I’ll manage. It’s part of my job to weather the ups and downs. And we can’t let you two miss your dinner,” she says. “But thank you for the offer, Katniss.”

Peeta, who spends much of the night roaming the train, hears me screaming as I struggle to break out of the haze of drugs that merely prolong the horrible dreams. He manages to wake me and calm me down. Then he climbs into bed to hold me until I fall back to sleep. After that, I refuse the pills. But every night I let him into my bed.

I can’t guess what form my punishment will take, how wide the net will be cast, but when it is finished, there will most likely be nothing left. So you would think that at this moment, I would be in utter despair. Here’s what’s strange. The main thing I feel is a sense of relief. That I can give up this game. That the question of whether I can succeed in this venture has been answered, even if that answer is a resounding no. That if desperate times call for desperate measures, then I am free to act as desperately as I wish.
Only not here, not quite yet. It’s essential to get back to District 12, because the main part of any plan will include my mother and sister, Gale and his family. And Peeta, if I can get him to come with us. I add Haymitch to the list. These are the people I must take with me when I escape into the wild. How I will convince them, where we will go in the dead of winter, what it will take to evade capture are unanswered questions. But at least now I know what I must do.
So instead of crumpling to the ground and weeping, I find myself standing up straighter and with more confidence than I have in weeks. My smile, while somewhat insane, is not forced. And when President Snow silences the audience and says, “What do you think about us throwing them a wedding right here in the Capitol?” I pull off girl-almost-catatonic-with-joy without a hitch.
Caesar Flickerman asks if the president has a date in mind.
“Oh, before we set a date, we better clear it with Katniss’s mother,” says the president. The audience gives a big laugh and the president puts his arm around me. “Maybe if the whole country puts its mind to it, we can get you married before you’re thirty.”

Peeta picks one up to take a sip and they lose it.
“Not here!” shrieks Octavia.

Peeta looks at the glass again and puts it together. “You mean this will make me puke?”
My prep team laughs hysterically. “Of course, so you can keep eating,” says Octavia. “I’ve been in there twice already. Everyone does it, or else how would you have any fun at a feast?”

We know only a few dances at home, the kind that go with fiddle and flute music and require a good deal of space. But Effie has shown us some that are popular in the Capitol. The music’s slow and dreamlike, so Peeta pulls me into his arms and we move in a circle with practically no steps at all. You could do this dance on a pie plate. We’re quiet for a while. Then Peeta speaks in a strained voice.
“You go along, thinking you can deal with it, thinking maybe they’re not so bad, and then you—” He cuts himself off.
All I can think of is the emaciated bodies of the children on our kitchen table as my mother prescribes what the parents can’t give. More food. Now that we’re rich, she’ll send some home with them. But often in the old days, there was nothing to give and the child was past saving, anyway. And here in the Capitol they’re vomiting for the pleasure of filling their bellies again and again. Not from some illness of body or mind, not from spoiled food. It’s what everyone does at a party. Expected. Part of the fun.
One day when I dropped by to give Hazelle the game, Vick was home sick with a bad cough. Being part of Gale’s family, the kid has to eat better than ninety percent of the rest of District 12. But he still spent about fifteen minutes talking about how they’d opened a can of corn syrup from Parcel Day and each had a spoonful on bread and were going to maybe have more later in the week. How Hazelle had said he could have a bit in a cup of tea to soothe his cough, but he wouldn’t feel right unless the others had some, too. If it’s like that at Gale’s, what’s it like in the other houses?
“Peeta, they bring us here to fight to the death for their entertainment,” I say. “Really, this is nothing by comparison.”
“I know. I know that. It’s just sometimes I can’t stand it anymore. To the point where…I’m not sure what I’ll do.” He pauses, then whispers, “Maybe we were wrong, Katniss.”

“About trying to subdue things in the districts,” he says."

She introduces him as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker. Plutarch asks Peeta if he can steal me for a dance. Peeta’s recovered his camera face and good-naturedly passes me over, warning the man not to get too attached.
I don’t want to dance with Plutarch Heavensbee. I don’t want to feel his hands, one resting against mine, one on my hip. I’m not used to being touched, except by Peeta or my family, and I rank Gamemakers somewhere below maggots in terms of creatures I want in contact with my skin. But he seems to sense this and holds me almost at arm’s length as we turn on the floor.
We chitchat about the party, about the entertainment, about the food, and then he makes a joke about avoiding punch since training. I don’t get it, and then I realize he’s the man who tripped backward into the punch bowl when I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers during the training session. Well, not really. I was shooting an apple out of their roast pig’s mouth. But I made them jump.
“Oh, you’re one who—” I laugh, remembering him splashing back into the punch bowl.
“Yes. And you’ll be pleased to know I’ve never recovered,” says Plutarch.
I want to point out that twenty-two dead tributes will never recover from the Games he helped create, either. But I only say, “Good. So, you’re the Head Gamemaker this year? That must be a big honor.”
“Between you and me, there weren’t many takers for the job,” he says. “So much responsibility as to how the Games turn out.”
Yeah, the last guy’s dead, I think. He must know about Seneca Crane, but he doesn’t look the least bit concerned. “Are you planning the Quarter Quell Games already?” I say.
“Oh, yes. Well, they’ve been in the works for years, of course. Arenas aren’t built in a day. But the, shall we say, flavor of the Games is being determined now. Believe it or not, I’ve got a strategy meeting tonight,” he says.
Plutarch steps back and pulls out a gold watch on a chain from a vest pocket. He flips open the lid, sees the time, and frowns. “I’ll have to be going soon.” He turns the watch so I can see the face. “It starts at midnight.”
“That seems late for—” I say, but then something distracts me. Plutarch has run his thumb across the crystal face of the watch and for just a moment an image appears, glowing as if lit by candlelight. It’s another mockingjay. Exactly like the pin on my dress. Only this one disappears. He snaps the watch closed.
“That’s very pretty,” I say.
“Oh, it’s more than pretty. It’s one of a kind,” he says. “If anyone asks about me, say I’ve gone home to bed. The meetings are supposed to be kept secret. But I thought it’d be safe to tell you.”
“Yes. Your secret’s safe with me,” I say.
As we shake hands, he gives a small bow, a common gesture here in the Capitol. “Well, I’ll see you next summer at the Games, Katniss. Best wishes on your engagement, and good luck with your mother.”
“I’ll need it,” I say.
Plutarch disappears and I wander through the crowd, looking for Peeta, as strangers congratulate me. On my engagement, on my victory at the Games, on my choice of lipstick. I respond, but really I’m thinking about Plutarch showing off his pretty, one-of-a-kind watch to me. There was something strange about it. Almost clandestine. But why? Maybe he thinks someone else will steal his idea of putting a disappearing mockingjay on a watch face. Yes, he probably paid a fortune for it and now he can’t show it to anyone because he’s afraid someone will make a cheap, knockoff version. Only in the Capitol."

“No nightmares,” he says.
“What?” I ask.
“You didn’t have any nightmares last night,” he says.
He’s right. For the first time in ages I’ve slept through the night. “I had a dream, though,” I say, thinking back. “I was following a mockingjay through the woods. For a long time. It was Rue, really. I mean, when it sang, it had her voice.”
“Where did she take you?” he says, brushing my hair off my forehead.
“I don’t know. We never arrived,” I say. “But I felt happy.”
“Well, you slept like you were happy,” he says.
“Peeta, how come I never know when you’re having a nightmare?” I say.
“I don’t know. I don’t think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror,” he says.
“You should wake me,” I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.
“It’s not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you,” he says. “I’m okay once I realize you’re here.”
Ugh. Peeta makes comments like this in such an offhand way, and it’s like being hit in the gut. He’s only answering my question honestly. He’s not pressing me to reply in kind, to make any declaration of love. But I still feel awful, as if I’ve been using him in some terrible way. Have I? I don’t know. I only know that for the first time, I feel immoral about him being here in my bed. Which is ironic since we’re officially engaged now.
“Be worse when we’re home and I’m sleeping alone again,” he says.

I could take hours trying to explain, and even then have him refuse me. Instead I go straight to the heart of my defense.
“President Snow personally threatened to have you killed,” I say.
Gale raises his eyebrows slightly, but there’s no real show of fear or astonishment. “Anyone else?”
“Well, he didn’t actually give me a copy of the list. But it’s a good guess it includes both our families,” I say.
It’s enough to bring him to the fire. He crouches before the hearth and warms himself. “Unless what?”
“Unless nothing, now,” I say. Obviously this requires more of an explanation, but I have no idea where to start, so I just sit there staring gloomily into the fire.
After about a minute of this, Gale breaks the silence. “Well, thanks for the heads-up.”
I turn to him, ready to snap, but I catch the glint in his eye. I hate myself for smiling. This is not a funny moment, but I guess it’s a lot to drop on someone. We’re all going to be obliterated no matter what. “I do have a plan, you know.”

If he thinks it’s a bad idea, I don’t want to know, because it’s the only one I have. “Katniss, hold up.” I kick a dirty, frozen chunk of snow off the path and let him catch up. The coal dust makes everything look especially ugly. “I really will go, if you want me to. I just think we better talk it through with Haymitch. Make sure we won’t be making things worse for everyone.” He raises his head. “What’s that?”
I lift my chin. I’ve been so consumed with my own worries, I haven’t noticed the strange noise coming from the square. A whistling, the sound of an impact, the intake of breath from a crowd.
“Come on,” Peeta says, his face suddenly hard. I don’t know why. I can’t place the sound, even guess at the situation. But it means something bad to him.
When we reach the square, it’s clear something’s happening, but the crowd’s too thick to see. Peeta steps up on a crate against the wall of the sweetshop and offers me a hand while he scans the square. I’m halfway up when he suddenly blocks my way. “Get down. Get out of here!” He’s whispering, but his voice is harsh with insistence.
“What?” I say, trying to force my way back up.
“Go home, Katniss! I’ll be there in a minute, I swear!” he says.
Whatever it is, it’s terrible. I yank away from his hand and begin to push my way through the crowd. People see me, recognize my face, and then look panicked. Hands shove me back. Voices hiss.
“Get out of here, girl.”
“Only make it worse.”
“What do you want to do? Get him killed?”
But at this point, my heart is beating so fast and fierce I hardly hear them. I only know that whatever waits in the middle of the square is meant for me. When I finally break through to the cleared space, I see I am right. And Peeta was right. And those voices were right, too.
Gale’s wrists are bound to a wooden post. The wild turkey he shot earlier hangs above him, the nail driven through its neck. His jacket’s been cast aside on the ground, his shirt torn away. He slumps unconscious on his knees, held up only by the ropes at his wrists. What used to be his back is a raw, bloody slab of meat.
Standing behind him is a man I’ve never seen, but I recognize his uniform. It’s the one designated for our Head Peacekeeper. This isn’t old Cray, though. This is a tall, muscular man with sharp creases in his pants.

It’s too late to stop the arm from descending, and I instinctively know I won’t have the power to block it. Instead I throw myself directly between the whip and Gale. I’ve flung out my arms to protect as much of his broken body as possible, so there’s nothing to deflect the lash. I take the full force of it across the left side of my face.
The pain is blinding and instantaneous. Jagged flashes of light cross my vision and I fall to my knees. One hand cups my cheek while the other keeps me from tipping over. I can already feel the welt rising up, the swelling closing my eye. The stones beneath me are wet with Gale’s blood, the air heavy with its scent. “Stop it! You’ll kill him!” I shriek.
I get a glimpse of my assailant’s face. Hard, with deep lines, a cruel mouth. Gray hair shaved almost to nonexistence, eyes so black they seem all pupils, a long, straight nose reddened by the freezing air. The powerful arm lifts again, his sights set on me. My hand flies to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. I grit my teeth in anticipation of the next lash.
“Hold it!” a voice barks. Haymitch appears and trips over a Peacekeeper lying on the ground. It’s Darius. A huge purple lump pushes through the red hair on his forehead. He’s knocked out but still breathing. What happened? Did he try to come to Gale’s aid before I got here?
Haymitch ignores him and pulls me to my feet roughly. “Oh, excellent.” His hand locks under my chin, lifting it. “She’s got a photo shoot next week modeling wedding dresses. What am I supposed to tell her stylist?”
I see a flicker of recognition in the eyes of the man with the whip. Bundled against the cold, my face free of makeup, my braid tucked carelessly under my coat, it wouldn’t be easy to identify me as the victor of the last Hunger Games. Especially with half my face swelling up. But Haymitch has been showing up on television for years, and he’d be difficult to forget.
The man rests the whip on his hip. “She interrupted the punishment of a confessed criminal.”
Everything about this man, his commanding voice, his odd accent, warns of an unknown and dangerous threat. Where has he come from? District 11? 3? From the Capitol itself?
“I don’t care if she blew up the blasted Justice Building! Look at her cheek! Think that will be camera ready in a week?” Haymitch snarls.
The man’s voice is still cold, but I can detect a slight edge of doubt. “That’s not my problem.”
“No? Well, it’s about to be, my friend. The first call I make when I get home is to the Capitol,” says Haymitch. “Find out who authorized you to mess up my victor’s pretty little face!”
“He was poaching. What business is it of hers, anyway?” says the man.
“He’s her cousin.” Peeta’s got my other arm now, but gently. “And she’s my fiancée. So if you want to get to him, expect to go through both of us.”
Maybe we’re it. The only three people in the district who could make a stand like this. Although it’s sure to be temporary. There will be repercussions. But at the moment, all I care about is keeping Gale alive. The new Head Peacekeeper glances over at his backup squad. With relief, I see they’re familiar faces, old friends from the Hob. You can tell by their expressions that they’re not enjoying the show.

“New Head,” Haymitch says, and she gives him a curt nod as if no other explanation is needed.
I’m filled with awe, as I always am, as I watch her transform from a woman who calls me to kill a spider to a woman immune to fear. When a sick or dying person is brought to her…this is the only time I think my mother knows who she is. In moments, the long kitchen table has been cleared, a sterile white cloth spread across it, and Gale hoisted onto it. My mother pours water from a kettle into a basin while ordering Prim to pull a series of her remedies from the medicine cabinet. Dried herbs and tinctures and store-bought bottles. I watch her hands, the long, tapered fingers crumbling this, adding drops of that, into the basin. Soaking a cloth in the hot liquid as she gives Prim instructions to prepare a second brew.
My mother glances my way. “Did it cut your eye?”
“No, it’s just swelled shut,” I say.
“Get more snow on it,” she instructs. But I am clearly not a priority.
“Can you save him?” I ask my mother. She says nothing as she wrings out the cloth and holds it in the air to cool somewhat."

Wordlessly, she sits on a stool next to the table, takes Gale’s hand, and holds it against her lips. My mother doesn’t acknowledge even her. She’s gone into that special zone that includes only herself and the patient and occasionally Prim. The rest of us can wait."

As the blood clears, I can see where every stroke of the lash landed and feel it resonate in the single cut on my face. I multiply my own pain once, twice, forty times and can only hope that Gale remains unconscious. Of course, that’s too much to ask for. As the final bandages are being placed, a moan escapes his lips. Hazelle strokes his hair and whispers something while my mother and Prim go through their meager store of painkillers, the kind usually accessible only to doctors. They are hard to come by, expensive, and always in demand. My mother has to save the strongest for the worst pain, but what is the worst pain? To me, it’s always the pain that is present. If I were in charge, those painkillers would be gone in a day because I have so little ability to watch suffering. My mother tries to save them for those who are actually in the process of dying, to ease them out of the world.
Since Gale is regaining consciousness, they decide on an herbal concoction he can take by mouth. “That won’t be enough,” I say. They stare at me. “That won’t be enough, I know how it feels. That will barely knock out a headache.”
“We’ll combine it with sleep syrup, Katniss, and he’ll manage it. The herbs are more for the inflammation—” my mother begins calmly.
“Just give him the medicine!” I scream at her. “Give it to him! Who are you, anyway, to decide how much pain he can stand!”
Gale begins stirring at my voice, trying to reach me. The movement causes fresh blood to stain his bandages and an agonized sound to come from his mouth.
“Take her out,” says my mother. Haymitch and Peeta literally carry me from the room while I shout obscenities at her. They pin me down on a bed in one of the extra bedrooms until I stop fighting.

“So it’s starting again?” she says. “Like before?”
“By the looks of it,” he answers. “Who’d have thought we’d ever be sorry to see old Cray go?”
Cray would have been disliked, anyway, because of the uniform he wore, but it was his habit of luring starving young women into his bed for money that made him an object of loathing in the district. In really bad times, the hungriest would gather at his door at nightfall, vying for the chance to earn a few coins to feed their families by selling their bodies. Had I been older when my father died, I might have been among them. Instead I learned to hunt.
I don’t know exactly what my mother means by things starting again, but I’m too angry and hurting to ask. It’s registered, though, the idea of worse times returning, because when the doorbell rings, I shoot straight out of bed. Who could it be at this hour of the night? There’s only one answer. Peacekeepers.
“They can’t"

When she opens it, there’s not a squad of Peacekeepers but a single, snow-caked figure. Madge. She holds out a small, damp cardboard box to me.
“Use these for your friend,” she says. I take off the lid of the box, revealing half a dozen vials of clear liquid. “They’re my mother’s. She said I could take them. Use them, please.” She runs back into the storm before we can stop her.
“Crazy girl,” Haymitch mutters as we follow my mother into the kitchen.
Whatever my mother had given Gale, I was right, it isn’t enough. His teeth are gritted and his flesh shines with sweat. My mother fills a syringe with the clear liquid from one of the vials and shoots it into his arm. Almost immediately, his face begins to relax.
“What is that stuff?” asks Peeta.
“It’s from the Capitol. It’s called morphling,” my mother answers.
“I didn’t even know Madge knew Gale,” says Peeta.
“We used to sell her strawberries,” I say almost angrily. What am I angry about, though? Not that she has brought the medicine, surely.
“She must have quite a taste for them,” says Haymitch.
That’s what nettles me. It’s the implication that there’s something going on between Gale and Madge. And I don’t like it.
“She’s my friend” is all I say."

I imagine watching Gale volunteering to save Rory in the reaping, having him torn from my life, becoming some strange girl’s lover to stay alive, and then coming home with her. Living next to her. Promising to marry her.
The hatred I feel for him, for the phantom girl, for everything, is so real and immediate that it chokes me. Gale is mine. I am his. Anything else is unthinkable. Why did it take him being whipped within an inch of his life to see it?
Because I’m selfish. I’m a coward. I’m the kind of girl who, when she might actually be of use, would run to stay alive and leave those who couldn’t follow to suffer and die. This is the girl Gale met in the woods today.
No wonder I won the Games. No decent person ever does.
You saved Peeta, I think weakly.
But now I question even that. I knew good and well that my life back in District 12 would be unlivable if I let that boy die.
I rest my head forward on the edge of the table, overcome with loathing for myself. Wishing I had died in the arena. Wishing Seneca Crane had blown me to bits the way President Snow said he should have when I held out the berries.
The berries. I realize the answer to who I am lies in that handful of poisonous fruit. If I held them out to save Peeta because I knew I would be shunned if I came back without him, then I am despicable. If I held them out because I loved him, I am still self-centered, although forgivable. But if I held them out to defy the Capitol, I am someone of worth. The trouble is, I don’t know exactly what was going on inside me at that moment.
Could it be the people in the districts are right? That it was an act of rebellion, even if it was an unconscious one? Because, deep down, I must know it isn’t enough to keep myself, or my family, or my friends alive by running away. Even if I could. It wouldn’t fix anything. It wouldn’t stop people from being hurt the way Gale was today.
Life in District 12 isn’t really so different from life in the arena. At some point, you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead. The hard thing is finding the courage to do it. Well, it’s not hard for Gale. He was born a rebel. I’m the one making an escape plan."

The white cloth has left creases on my good cheek. The other, the one that took the lash from Thread, throbs painfully. Gale’s dead to the world, but his fingers are locked around mine. I smell fresh bread and turn my stiff neck to find Peeta looking down at me with such a sad expression. I get the sense that he’s been watching us awhile.
“Go on up to bed, Katniss. I’ll look after him now,” he says.
“Peeta. About what I said yesterday, about running—” I begin.
“I know,” he says. “There’s nothing to explain.”
I see the loaves of bread on the counter in the pale, snowy morning light. The blue shadows under his eyes. I wonder if he slept at all. Couldn’t have been long. I think of his agreeing to go with me yesterday, his stepping up beside me to protect Gale, his willingness to throw his lot in with mine entirely when I give him so little in return. No matter what I do, I’m hurting someone. “Peeta—”

Less than a day ago, I was prepared to head into the wilderness with my loved ones in midwinter, with the very real possibility of the Capitol pursuing us. A precarious venture at best. But now I am committing to something even more risky. Fighting the Capitol assures their swift retaliation. I must accept that at any moment I can be arrested. There will be a knock on the door, like the one last night, a band of Peacekeepers to haul me away. There might be torture. Mutilation. A bullet through my skull in the town square, if I’m fortunate enough to go that quickly. The Capitol has no end of creative ways to kill people. I imagine these things and I’m terrified, but let’s face it: They’ve been lurking in the back of my brain, anyway. I’ve been a tribute in the Games. Been threatened by the president. Taken a lash across my face. I’m already a target.
Now comes the harder part. I have to face the fact that my family and friends might share this fate. Prim. I need only to think of Prim and all my resolve disintegrates. It’s my job to protect her. I pull the blanket up over my head, and my breathing is so rapid I use up all the oxygen and begin to choke for air. I can’t let the Capitol hurt Prim.
And then it hits me. They already have. They have killed her father in those wretched mines. They have sat by as she almost starved to death. They have chosen her as a tribute, then made her watch her sister fight to the death in the Games. She has been hurt far worse than I had at the age of twelve. And even that pales in comparison with Rue’s life."

“It’s lucky we have snow,” says my mother.
I think of what it must be like to recover from a whipping in midsummer, with the searing heat and the tepid water from the tap. “What did you do in warm months?” I ask.

But we couldn’t have been more wrong. The square has been transformed. A huge banner with the seal of Panem hangs off the roof of the Justice Building. Peacekeepers, in pristine white uniforms, march on the cleanly swept cobblestones. Along the rooftops, more of them occupy nests of machine guns. Most unnerving is a line of new constructions—an official whipping post, several stockades, and a gallows—set up in the center of the square.
“Thread’s a quick worker,” says Haymitch.
Some streets away from the square, I see a blaze flare up. None of us has to say it. That can only be the Hob going up in smoke. I think of Greasy Sae, Ripper, all my friends who make their living there.

“Me, too. Maybe that will hold him until Ripper finds a way to be back in business,” says Peeta. “I need to check on my family.”

As the days pass, things go from bad to worse. The mines stay shut for two weeks, and by that time half of District 12 is starving. The number of kids signing up for tesserae soars, but they often don’t receive their grain. Food shortages begin, and even those with money come away from stores empty-handed. When the mines reopen, wages are cut, hours extended, miners sent into blatantly dangerous work sites. The eagerly awaited food promised for Parcel Day arrives spoiled and defiled by rodents. The installations in the square see plenty of action as people are dragged in and punished for offenses so long overlooked we’ve forgotten they are illegal.
Gale goes home with no more talk of rebellion between us. But I can’t help thinking that everything he sees will only strengthen his resolve to fight back. The hardships in the mines, the tortured bodies in the square, the hunger on the faces of his family. Rory has signed up for tesserae, something Gale can’t even speak about, but it’s still not enough with the inconsistent availability and the ever-increasing price of food.
The only bright spot is, I get Haymitch to hire Hazelle as a housekeeper, resulting in some extra money for her and greatly increasing Haymitch’s standard of living. It’s weird going into his house, finding it fresh and clean, food warming on the stove. He hardly notices because he’s fighting a whole different battle. Peeta and I tried to ration what white liquor we had, but it’s almost run out, and the last time I saw Ripper, she was in the stocks.
I feel like a pariah when I walk through the streets. Everyone avoids me in public now. But there’s no shortage of company at home. A steady supply of ill and injured is deposited in our kitchen before my mother, who has long since stopped charging for her services. Her stocks of remedies are running so low, though, that soon all she’ll have to treat the patients with is snow.
The woods, of course, are forbidden. Absolutely. No question. Even Gale doesn’t challenge this now. But one morning, I do. And it isn’t the house full of the sick and dying, the bleeding backs, the gaunt-faced children, the marching boots, or the omnipresent misery that drives me under the fence. It’s the arrival of a crate of wedding dresses one night with a note from Effie saying that President Snow approved these himself."

People are starving all over the district and we still have more than enough. So I’ve been spreading things around a little. I have my own priorities: Gale’s family, Greasy Sae, some of the other Hob traders who were shut down. My mother has other people, patients mostly, who she wants to help.

I was actually buying time to go to the lake without her worrying. I intended to deliver the food this evening on my return, but now I can see that won’t be happening.
From the bag I pull two fresh buns with a layer of cheese baked into the top. We always seem to have a supply of these since Peeta found out they were my favorite.

“Yeah, eat up,” I say. Bonnie holds the bun as if she can’t quite believe it’s real and then sinks her teeth into it again and again, unable to stop. “It’s better if you chew it.” She nods, trying to slow down, but I know how hard it is when you’re that hollow. “I"

It was always there, of course, to some degree. But what differed was that talk was no longer sufficient, and the idea of taking action went from a wish to a reality. The textile factories that service Panem are loud with machinery, and the din also allowed word to pass safely, a pair of lips close to an ear, words unnoticed, unchecked. Twill taught at school, Bonnie was one of her pupils, and when the final bell had rung, both of them spent a fourhour shift at the factory that specialized in the Peacekeeper uniforms. It took months for Bonnie, who worked in the chilly inspection dock, to secure the two uniforms, a boot here, a pair of pants there. They were intended for Twill and her husband because it was understood that, once the uprising began, it would be crucial to get word of it out beyond District 8 if it were to spread and be successful.
The day Peeta and I came through and made our Victory Tour appearance was actually a rehearsal of sorts. People in the crowd positioned themselves according to their teams, next to the buildings they would target when the rebellion broke out. That was the plan: to take over the centers of power in the city like the Justice Building, the Peacekeepers’ Headquarters, and the Communication Center in the square. And at other locations in the district: the railroad, the granary, the power station, and the armory.
The night of my engagement, the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed his undying love for me in front of the cameras in the Capitol, was the night the uprising began. It was an ideal cover. Our Victory Tour interview with Caesar Flickerman was mandatory viewing. It gave the people of District 8 a reason to be out on the streets after dark, gathering either in the square or in various community centers around the city to watch. Ordinarily such activity would have been too suspicious. Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour, eight o’clock, when the masks went on and all hell broke loose.

But then the ax fell. Peacekeepers began to arrive by the thousands. Hovercraft bombed the rebel strongholds into ashes. In the utter chaos that followed, it was all people could do to make it back to their homes alive. It took less than forty-eight hours to subdue the city. Then, for a week, there was a lockdown. No food, no coal, everyone forbidden to leave their homes. The only time the television showed anything but static was when the suspected instigators were hanged in the square. Then one night, as the whole district was on the brink of starvation, came the order to return to business as usual.
That meant school for Twill and Bonnie. A street made impassable by the bombs caused them to be late for their factory shift, so they were still a hundred yards away when it exploded, killing everyone inside—including Twill’s husband and Bonnie’s entire family.

I give a grunt of disbelief. “You’re going to District Thirteen based on that? A shot of a bird? You think you’re going to find some new city with people strolling around in it? And that’s just fine with the Capitol?”
“No,” Twill says earnestly. “We think the people moved underground when everything on the surface was destroyed. We think they’ve managed to survive. And we think the Capitol leaves them alone because, before the Dark Days, District Thirteen’s principal industry was nuclear development.”
“They were graphite miners,” I say. But then I hesitate, because that’s information I got from the Capitol.

Haymitch and Peeta are there as well, sitting in a pair of matching rockers, playing a game of chess. Were they here by chance or “invited” by the Peacekeepers? Either way, I’m glad to see them.
“So where haven’t you been?” says Haymitch in a bored voice.
“Well, I haven’t been talking to the Goat Man about getting Prim’s goat pregnant, because someone gave me completely inaccurate information as to where he lives,” I say to Prim emphatically.
“No, I didn’t,” says Prim. “I told you exactly.”
“You said he lives beside the west entrance to the mine,” I say.
“The east entrance,” Prim corrects me.

“The slag heap next to the east entrance,” says Prim patiently.
“No. When did you say that?” I demand.
“Last night,” Haymitch chimes in.
“It was definitely the east,” adds Peeta. He looks at Haymitch and they laugh. I glare at Peeta and he tries to look contrite. “I’m sorry, but it’s what I’ve been saying. You don’t listen when people talk to you.”
“Bet people told you he didn’t live there today and you didn’t listen again,” says Haymitch.
“Shut up, Haymitch,” I say, clearly indicating he’s right.
Haymitch and Peeta crack up and Prim allows herself a smile.
“Fine. Somebody else can arrange to get the stupid goat knocked up,” I say, which makes them laugh more. And I think, This is why they’ve made it this far, Haymitch and Peeta. Nothing throws them.
I look at the Peacekeepers. The man’s smiling but the woman is unconvinced. “What’s in the bag?” she asks sharply.
I know she’s hoping for game or wild plants. Something that clearly condemns me. I dump the contents on the table. “See for yourself.”
“Oh, good,” says my mother, examining the cloth. “We’re running low on bandages.”
Peeta comes to the table and opens the candy bag. “Ooh, peppermints,” he says, popping one in his mouth.
“They’re mine.” I take a swipe for the bag. He tosses it to Haymitch, who stuffs a fistful of sweets in his mouth before passing the bag to a giggling Prim. “None of you deserves candy!” I say.
“What, because we’re right?” Peeta wraps his arms around me. I give a small yelp of pain as my tailbone objects. I try to turn it into a sound of indignation, but I can see in his eyes that he knows I’m hurt. “Okay, Prim said west. I distinctly heard west. And we’re all idiots. How’s that?”
“Better,” I say, and accept his kiss. Then I look at the Peacekeepers as if I’m suddenly remembering they’re there. “You have a message for me?”
“From Head Peacekeeper Thread,” says the woman. “He wanted you to know that the fence surrounding District Twelve will now have electricity twenty-four hours a day.”
“Didn’t it already?” I ask, a little too innocently.
“He thought you might be interested in passing this information on to your cousin,” says the woman.
“Thank you. I’ll tell him. I’m sure we’ll all sleep a little more soundly now that security has addressed that lapse.” I’m pushing things, I know it, but the comment gives me a sense of satisfaction.

It’s an old thing, made of parchment and leather. Some herbalist on my mother’s side of the family started it ages ago. The book’s composed of page after page of ink drawings of plants with descriptions of their medical uses. My father added a section on edible plants that was my guidebook to keeping us alive after his death. For a long time, I’ve wanted to record my own knowledge in it. Things I learned from experience or from Gale, and then the information I picked up when I was training for the Games. I didn’t because I’m no artist and it’s so crucial that the pictures are drawn in exact detail. That’s where Peeta comes in. Some of the plants he knows already, others we have dried samples of, and others I have to describe. He makes sketches on scrap paper until I’m satisfied they’re right, then I let him draw them in the book. After that, I carefully print all I know about the plant.
It’s quiet, absorbing work that helps take my mind off my troubles. I like to watch his hands as he works, making a blank page bloom with strokes of ink, adding touches of color to our previously black and yellowish book. His face takes on a special look when he concentrates. His usual easy expression is replaced by something more intense and removed that suggests an entire world locked away inside him. I’ve seen flashes of this before: in the arena, or when he speaks to a crowd, or that time he shoved the Peacekeepers’ guns away from me in District 11. I don’t know quite what to make of it. I also become a little fixated on his eyelashes, which ordinarily you don’t notice much because they’re so blond. But up close, in the sunlight slanting in from the window, they’re a light golden color and so long I don’t see how they keep from getting all tangled up when he blinks."

Usually we only watch when it’s mandatory, because the mixture of propaganda and displays of the Capitol’s power—including clips from seventy-four years of Hunger Games—is so odious. But now I’m looking for something special. The mockingjay that Bonnie and Twill are basing all their hopes on. I know it’s probably foolishness, but if it is, I want to rule it out. And erase the idea of a thriving District 13 from my mind for good.
My first sighting is in a news story referencing the Dark Days. I see the smoldering remains of the Justice Building in District 13 and just catch the black-and-white underside of a mockingjay’s wing as it flies across the upper right-hand corner. That doesn’t prove anything, really. It’s just an old shot that goes with an old tale.
However, several days later, something else grabs my attention. The main newscaster is reading a piece about a shortage of graphite affecting the manufacturing of items in District 3. They cut to what is supposed to be live footage of a female reporter, encased in a protective suit, standing in front of the ruins of the Justice Building in 13. Through her mask, she reports that unfortunately a study has just today determined that the mines of District 13 are still too toxic to approach. End of story. But just before they cut back to the main newscaster, I see the unmistakable flash of that same mockingjay’s wing.
The reporter has simply been incorporated into the old footage. She’s not in District 13 at all. Which begs the question, What is?"

“Why couldn’t you get shrimp? Is it out of season?” I ask.
“Oh, Katniss, we haven’t been able to get any seafood for weeks!” says Octavia. “You know, because the weather’s been so bad in District Four.”
My mind starts buzzing. No seafood. For weeks. From District 4. The barely concealed rage in the crowd during the Victory Tour. And suddenly I am absolutely sure that District 4 has revolted.
I begin to question them casually about what other hardships this winter has brought them. They are not used to want, so any little disruption in supply makes an impact on them. By the time I’m ready to be dressed, their complaints about the difficulty of getting different products—from crabmeat to music chips to ribbons—has given me a sense of which districts might actually be rebelling. Seafood from District 4. Electronic gadgets from District 3. And, of course, fabrics from District 8. The thought of such widespread rebellion has me quivering with fear and excitement."

Initially, Cinna designed two dozen wedding gowns. Since then, there’s been the process of narrowing down the designs, creating the dresses, and choosing the accessories. Apparently, in the Capitol, there were opportunities to vote for your favorites at each stage. This is all culminating with shots of me in the final six dresses, which I’m sure took no time at all to insert in the show. Each shot is met with a huge reaction from the crowd. People screaming and cheering for their favorites, booing the ones they don’t like. Having voted, and probably bet on the winner, people are very invested in my wedding gown. It’s bizarre to watch when I think how I never even bothered to try one on before the cameras arrived. Caesar announces that interested parties must cast their final vote by noon on the following day.
“Let’s get Katniss Everdeen to her wedding in style!” he hollers to the crowd.

The little boy in white steps forward, holding out the box as he opens the lid. We can see the tidy, upright rows of yellowed envelopes. Whoever devised the Quarter Quell system had prepared for centuries of Hunger Games. The president removes an envelope clearly marked with a 75. He runs his finger under the flap and pulls out a small square of paper. Without hesitation, he reads, “On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors.”
My mother gives a faint shriek and Prim buries her face in her hands, but I feel more like the people I see in the crowd on television. Slightly baffled. What does it mean? Existing pool of victors?
Then I get it, what it means. At least, for me. District 12 only has three existing victors to choose from. Two male. One female…

Back in the place of nightmares. That’s where I am going. I have to admit I didn’t see it coming. I saw a multitude of other things. Being publicly humiliated, tortured, and executed. Fleeing through the wilderness, pursued by Peacekeepers and hovercraft. Marriage to Peeta with our children forced into the arena. But never that I myself would have to be a player in the Games again. Why? Because there’s no precedent for it. Victors are out of the reaping for life. That’s the deal if you win. Until now.
There’s some kind of sheeting, the kind they put down when they paint. I pull it over me like a blanket. In the distance, someone is calling my name. But at the moment, I excuse myself from thinking about even those I love most. I think only of me. And what lies ahead.
The sheeting’s stiff but holds warmth. My muscles relax, my heart rate slows. I see the wooden box in the little boy’s hands, President Snow drawing out the yellowed envelope. Is it possible that this was really the Quarter Quell written down seventy-five years ago? It seems unlikely. It’s just too perfect an answer for the troubles that face the Capitol today. Getting rid of me and subduing the districts all in one neat little package.
I hear President Snow’s voice in my head. “On the seventy-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors.”
Yes, victors are our strongest. They’re the ones who survived the arena and slipped the noose of poverty that strangles the rest of us. They, or should I say we, are the very embodiment of hope where there is no hope. And now twenty-three of us will be killed to show how even that hope was an illusion.
I’m glad I won only last year. Otherwise I’d know all the other victors, not just because I see them on television but because they’re guests at every Games. Even if they’re not mentoring like Haymitch always has to, most return to the Capitol each year for the event. I think a lot of them are friends. Whereas the only friend I’ll have to worry about killing will be either Peeta or Haymitch. Peeta or Haymitch!
I sit straight up, throwing off the sheeting. What just went through my mind? There’s no situation in which I would ever kill Peeta or Haymitch. But one of them will be in the arena with me, and that’s a fact. They may have even decided between them who it will be. Whoever is picked first, the other will have the option of volunteering to take his place. I already know what will happen. Peeta will ask Haymitch to let him go into the arena with me no matter what. For my sake. To protect me.
I stumble around the cellar, looking for an exit. How did I even get into this place? I feel my way up the steps to the kitchen and see the glass window in the door has been shattered. Must be why my hand seems to be bleeding. I hurry back into the night and head straight to Haymitch’s house. He’s sitting alone at the kitchen table, a half-emptied bottle of white liquor in one fist, his knife in the other. Drunk as a skunk.
“Ah, there she is. All tuckered out. Finally did the math, did you, sweetheart? Worked out you won’t be going in alone? And now you’re here to ask me…what?” he says.
I don’t answer. The window’s wide open and the wind cuts through me just as if I were outside.
“I’ll admit, it was easier for the boy. He was here before I could snap the seal on a bottle. Begging me for another chance to go in. But what can you say?” He mimics my voice. “‘Take his place, Haymitch, because all things being equal, I’d rather Peeta had a crack at the rest of his life than you?’”

“I came for a drink,” I say.
Haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me. I run my sleeve across the top and take a couple gulps before I come up choking. It takes a few minutes to compose myself, and even then my eyes and nose are still streaming. But inside me, the liquor feels like fire and I like it.

“Peeta’s argument is that since I chose you, I now owe him. Anything he wants. And what he wants is the chance to go in again to protect you,” says Haymitch.
I knew it. In this way, Peeta’s not hard to predict. While I was wallowing around on the floor of that cellar, thinking only of myself, he was here, thinking only of me. Shame isn’t a strong enough word for what I feel.
“You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know,” Haymitch says.
“Yeah, yeah,” I say brusquely. “No question, he’s the superior one in this trio. So, what are you going to do?”
“I don’t know.” Haymitch sighs. “Go back in with you maybe, if I can. If my name’s drawn at the reaping, it won’t matter. He’ll just volunteer to take my place.”
We sit for a while in silence. “It’d be bad for you in the arena, wouldn’t it? Knowing all the others?” I ask.
“Oh, I think we can count on it being unbearable wherever I am.” He nods at the bottle. “Can I have that back now?”
“No,” I say, wrapping my arms around it. Haymitch pulls another bottle out from under the table and gives the top a twist. But I realize I am not just here for a drink. There’s something else I want from Haymitch. “Okay, I figured out what I’m asking,” I say. “If it is Peeta and me in the Games, this time we try to keep him alive.”
Something flickers across his bloodshot eyes. Pain.
“Like you said, it’s going to be bad no matter how you slice it. And whatever Peeta wants, it’s his turn to be saved. We both owe him that.” My voice takes on a pleading tone. “Besides, the Capitol hates me so much, I’m as good as dead now. He still might have a chance. Please, Haymitch. Say you’ll help me.”
He frowns at his bottle, weighing my words. “All right,” he says finally.
“Thanks,” I say. I should go see Peeta now, but I don’t want to. My head’s spinning from the drink, and I’m so wiped out, who knows what he could get me to agree to? No, now I have to go home to face my mother and Prim.
As I stagger up the steps to my house, the front door opens and Gale pulls me into his arms. “I was wrong. We should have gone when you said,” he whispers.
“No,” I say. I’m having trouble focusing, and liquor keeps sloshing out of my bottle and down the back of Gale’s jacket, but he doesn’t seem to care.
“It’s not too late,” he says.
Over his shoulder, I see my mother and Prim clutching each other in the doorway. We run. They die. And now I’ve got Peeta to protect. End of discussion. “Yeah, it is.” My knees give way and he’s holding me up. As the alcohol overcomes my mind, I hear the glass bottle shatter on the floor. This seems appropriate since I have obviously lost my grip on everything.
When I wake up, I barely get to the toilet before the white liquor makes its reappearance. It burns just as much coming up as it did going down, and tastes twice as bad. I’m trembling and sweaty when I finish vomiting, but at least most of the stuff is out of my system. Enough made it into my bloodstream, though, to result in a pounding headache, parched mouth, and boiling stomach.
I turn on the shower and stand under the warm rain for a minute before I realize I’m still in my underclothes. My mother must have just stripped off my filthy outer ones and tucked me in bed. I throw the wet undergarments into the sink and pour shampoo on my head. My hands sting, and that’s when I notice the stitches, small and even, across one palm and up the side of the other hand.

I have to pull myself together to be calm and reassuring, the way I was when we said our good-byes the day of the last reaping. I have to be strong. I struggle into an upright position, push my wet hair off my throbbing temples, and brace myself for this meeting. They appear in the doorway, holding tea and toast, their faces filled with concern. I open my mouth, planning to start off with some kind of joke, and burst into tears.
So much for being strong.
My mother sits on the side of the bed and Prim crawls right up next to me and they hold me, making quiet soothing sounds, until I am mostly cried out.

Then I walk across the lawn to his house. He’s only just waking up and accepts the mug without comment. We sit there, almost peacefully, sipping our broth and watching the sun set through his living room window. I hear someone walking around upstairs and I assume it’s Hazelle, but a few minutes later Peeta comes down and tosses a cardboard box of empty liquor bottles on the table with finality.
“There, it’s done,” he says.
It’s taking all of Haymitch’s resources to focus his eyes on the bottles, so I speak up. “What’s done?”
“I’ve poured all the liquor down the drain,” says Peeta.
This seems to jolt Haymitch out of his stupor, and he paws through the box in disbelief. “You what?”
“I tossed the lot,” says Peeta.
“He’ll just buy more,” I say.
“No, he won’t,” says Peeta. “I tracked down Ripper this morning and told her I’d turn her in the second she sold to either of you. I paid her off, too, just for good measure, but I don’t think she’s eager to be back in the Peacekeepers’ custody.”
Haymitch takes a swipe with his knife but Peeta deflects it so easily it’s pathetic. Anger rises up in me. “What business is it of yours what he does?”
“It’s completely my business. However it falls out, two of us are going to be in the arena again with the other as mentor. We can’t afford any drunkards on this team. Especially not you, Katniss,” says Peeta to me.
“What?” I sputter indignantly. It would be more convincing if I weren’t still so hungover. “Last night’s the only time I’ve ever even been drunk.”
“Yeah, and look at the shape you’re in,” says Peeta.
I don’t know what I expected from my first meeting with Peeta after the announcement. A few hugs and kisses. A little comfort maybe. Not this. I turn to Haymitch. “Don’t worry, I’ll get you more liquor.”
“Then I’ll turn you both in. Let you sober up in the stocks,” says Peeta.
“What’s the point to this?” asks Haymitch.
“The point is that two of us are coming home from the Capitol. One mentor and one victor,” says Peeta. “Effie’s sending me recordings of all the living victors. We’re going to watch their Games and learn everything we can about how they fight. We’re going to put on weight and get strong. We’re going to start acting like Careers. And one of us is going to be victor again whether you two like it or not!” He sweeps out of the room, slamming the front door.
Haymitch and I wince at the bang.
“I don’t like self-righteous people,” I say.
“What’s to like?” says Haymitch, who begins sucking the dregs out of the empty bottles.
“You and me. That’s who he plans on coming home,” I say.
“Well, then the joke’s on him,” says Haymitch.
But after a few days, we agree to act like Careers, because this is the best way to get Peeta ready as well. Every night we watch the old recaps of the Games that the remaining victors won. I realize we never met any of them on the Victory Tour, which seems odd in retrospect. When I bring it up, Haymitch says the last thing President Snow would’ve wanted was to show Peeta and me—especially me—bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious districts. Victors have a special status, and if they appeared to be supporting my defiance of the Capitol, it would’ve been dangerous politically. Adjusting for age, I realize some of our opponents may be elderly, which is both sad and reassuring. Peeta takes copious notes, Haymitch volunteers information about the victors’ personalities, and slowly we begin to know our competition.
Every morning we do exercises to strengthen our bodies. We run and lift things and stretch our muscles. Every afternoon we work on combat skills, throwing knives, fighting hand to hand; I even teach them to climb trees. Officially, tributes aren’t supposed to train, but no one tries to stop us. Even in regular years, the tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 show up able to wield spears and swords. This is nothing by comparison.
After all the years of abuse, Haymitch’s body resists improvement. He’s still remarkably strong, but the shortest run winds him. And you’d think a guy who sleeps every night with a knife might actually be able to hit the side of a house with one, but his hands shake so badly it takes weeks for him to achieve even that.

It’s weird for me, being in conversations with both Peeta and Gale, but they seem to have set aside whatever issues they have about me.
One night, as I’m walking Gale back into town, he even admits, “It’d be better if he were easier to hate.”
“Tell me about it,” I say. “If I could’ve just hated him in the arena, we all wouldn’t be in this mess now. He’d be dead, and I’d be a happy little victor all by myself.”
“And where would we be, Katniss?” asks Gale.
I pause, not knowing what to say. Where would I be with my pretend cousin who wouldn’t be my cousin if it weren’t for Peeta? Would he have still kissed me and would I have kissed him back had I been free to do so? Would I have let myself open up to him, lulled by the security of money and food and the illusion of safety being a victor could bring under different circumstances? But there would still always be the reaping looming over us, over our children. No matter what I wanted…
“Hunting. Like every Sunday,” I say. I know he didn’t mean the question literally, but this is as much as I can honestly give. Gale knows I chose him over Peeta when I didn’t make a run for it. To me, there’s no point in talking about things that might have been. Even if I had killed Peeta in the arena, I still wouldn’t have wanted to marry anyone. I only got engaged to save people’s lives, and that completely backfired.
I’m afraid, anyway, that any kind of emotional scene with Gale might cause him to do something drastic. Like start that uprising in the mines. And as Haymitch says, District 12 isn’t ready for that. If anything, they’re less ready than before the Quarter Quell announcement, because the following morning another hundred Peacekeepers arrived on the train.

“Thank you. I had it especially done to match Katniss’s pin. I was thinking we might get you a golden ankle band and maybe find Haymitch a gold bracelet or something so we could all look like a team,” says Effie.
Evidently, Effie doesn’t know that my mockingjay pin is now a symbol used by the rebels. At least in District 8. In the Capitol, the mockingjay is still a fun reminder of an especially exciting Hunger Games. What else could it be? Real rebels don’t put a secret symbol on something as durable as jewelry. They put it on a wafer of bread that can be eaten in a second if necessary.
“I think that’s a great idea,” says Peeta. “How about it, Haymitch?”
“Yeah, whatever,” says Haymitch. He’s not drinking but I can tell he’d like to be. Effie had them take her own wine away when she saw the effort he was making, but he’s in a miserable state. If he were the tribute, he would have owed Peeta nothing and could be as drunk as he liked. Now it’s going to take all he’s got to keep Peeta alive in an arena full of his old friends, and he’ll probably fail.
“Maybe we could get you a wig, too,” I say in an attempt at lightness. He just shoots me a look that says to leave him alone, and we all eat our custard in silence.
“Shall we watch the recap of the reapings?” says Effie, dabbing at the corners of her mouth with a white linen napkin.
Peeta goes off to retrieve his notebook on the remaining living victors, and we gather in the compartment with the television to see who our competition will be in the arena. We are all in place as the anthem begins to play and the annual recap of the reaping ceremonies in the twelve districts begins.
In the history of the Games, there have been seventy-five victors. Fifty-nine are still alive. I recognize many of their faces, either from seeing them as tributes or mentors at previous Games or from our recent viewing of the victors’ tapes. Some are so old or wasted by illness, drugs, or drink that I can’t place them. As one would expect, the pools of Career tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 are the largest. But every district has managed to scrape up at least one female and one male victor.
The reapings go by quickly. Peeta studiously puts stars by the names of the chosen tributes in his notebook. Haymitch watches, his face devoid of emotion, as friends of his step up to take the stage. Effie makes hushed, distressed comments like “Oh, not Cecelia” or “Well, Chaff never could stay out of a fight,” and sighs frequently.

There’s the classically beautiful brother and sister from District 1 who were victors in consecutive years when I was little. Brutus, a volunteer from District 2, who must be at least forty and apparently can’t wait to get back in the arena. Finnick, the handsome bronze-haired guy from District 4 who was crowned ten years ago at the age of fourteen. A hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from 4, but she’s quickly replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman who needs a cane to walk to the stage. Then there’s Johanna Mason, the only living female victor from 7, who won a few years back by pretending she was a weakling. The woman from 8 who Effie calls Cecelia, who looks about thirty, has to detach herself from the three kids who run up to cling to her. Chaff, a man from 11 who I know to be one of Haymitch’s particular friends, is also in.
I’m called. Then Haymitch. And Peeta volunteers. One of the announcers actually gets teary because it seems the odds will never be in our favor, we star-crossed lovers of District 12. Then she pulls herself together to say she bets that “these will be the best Games ever!”

I just sit there watching Peeta rip out the pages of the victors who were not picked.
“Why don’t you get some sleep?” he says.
Because I can’t handle the nightmares. Not without you, I think. They are sure to be dreadful tonight. But I can hardly ask Peeta to come sleep with me. We’ve barely touched since that night Gale was whipped. “What are you going to do?” I ask.

“Thanks,” I say.
“And I added a touch of honey to the milk. For sweetness. And just a pinch of spice,” he adds. He looks at us like he wants to say more, then gives his head a slight shake and backs out of the room.

“I think he feels bad for us,” says Peeta.

There’s a woman, not Effie, calling the names in 12, but she still begins with “Ladies first!” She calls out the name of a girl who’s from the Seam, you can tell by the look of her, and then I hear the name “Maysilee Donner.”
“Oh!” I say. “She was my mother’s friend.” The camera finds her in the crowd, clinging to two other girls. All blond. All definitely merchants’ kids.
“I think that’s your mother hugging her,” says Peeta quietly. And he’s right. As Maysilee Donner bravely disengages herself and heads for the stage, I catch a glimpse of my mother at my age, and no one has exaggerated her beauty. Holding her hand and weeping is another girl who looks just like Maysilee. But a lot like someone else I know, too.
“Madge,” I say.
“That’s her mother. She and Maysilee were twins or something,” Peeta says. “My dad mentioned it once.”
I think of Madge’s mother. Mayor Undersee’s wife. Who spends half her life in bed immobilized with terrible pain, shutting out the world. I think of how I never realized that she and my mother shared this connection. Of Madge showing up in that snowstorm to bring the painkiller for Gale. Of my mockingjay pin and how it means something completely different now that I know that its former owner was Madge’s aunt, Maysilee Donner, a tribute who was murdered in the arena."
highlight,Catching Fire,Suzanne Collins,2023-12-16T21:11:05.867,2023-12-16T21:11:32Z,,"Now it’s the morning the Games begin. We watch from the point of view of one of the tributes as she rises up through the tube from the Launch Room and into the arena. I can’t help but give a slight gasp. Disbelief is reflected on the faces of the players. Even Haymitch’s eyebrows lift in pleasure, although they almost immediately knit themselves back into a scowl.
It’s the most breathtaking place imaginable. The golden Cornucopia sits in the middle of a green meadow with patches of gorgeous flowers. The sky is azure blue with puffy white clouds. Bright songbirds flutter overhead. By the way some of the tributes are sniffing, it must smell fantastic. An aerial shot shows that the meadow stretches for miles. Far in the distance, in one direction, there seems to be a woods, in the other, a snowcapped mountain.
The beauty disorients many of the players, because when the gong sounds, most of them seem like they’re trying to wake from a dream. Not Haymitch, though. He’s at the Cornucopia, armed with weapons and a backpack of choice supplies. He heads for the woods before most of the others have stepped off their plates.
Eighteen tributes are killed in the bloodbath that first day. Others begin to die off and it becomes clear that almost everything in this pretty place—the luscious fruit dangling from the bushes, the water in the crystalline streams, even the scent of the flowers when inhaled too directly—is deadly poisonous. Only the rainwater and the food provided at the Cornucopia are safe to consume. There’s also a large, well-stocked Career pack of ten tributes scouring the mountain area for victims.
Haymitch has his own troubles over in the woods, where the fluffy golden squirrels turn out to be carnivorous and attack in packs, and the butterfly stings bring agony if not death. But he persists in moving forward, always keeping the distant mountain at his back.
Maysilee Donner turns out to be pretty resourceful herself, for a girl who leaves the Cornucopia with only a small backpack. Inside she finds a bowl, some dried beef, and a blowgun with two dozen darts. Making use of the readily available poisons, she soon turns the blowgun into a deadly weapon by dipping the darts in lethal substances and directing them into her opponents’ flesh.
Four days in, the picturesque mountain erupts in a volcano that wipes out another dozen players, including all but five of the Career pack. With the mountain spewing liquid fire, and the meadow offering no means of concealment, the remaining thirteen tributes—including Haymitch and Maysilee—have no choice but to confine themselves to the woods.
Haymitch seems bent on continuing in the same direction, away from the now volcanic mountain, but a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle back into the center of the woods, where he encounters three of the Careers and pulls his knife. They may be much bigger and stronger, but Haymitch has remarkable speed and has killed two when the third disarms him. That Career is about to slit his throat when a dart drops him to the ground.
Maysilee Donner steps out of the woods. “We’d live longer with two of us.”
“Guess you just proved that,” says Haymitch, rubbing his neck. “Allies?” Maysilee nods. And there they are, instantly drawn into one of those pacts you’d be hard-pressed to break if you ever expect to go home and face your district.
Just like Peeta and me, they do better together. Get more rest, work out a system to salvage more rainwater, fight as a team, and share the food from the dead tributes’ packs. But Haymitch is still determined to keep moving on.
“Why?” Maysilee keeps asking, and he ignores her until she refuses to move any farther without an answer.
“Because it has to end somewhere, right?” says Haymitch. “The arena can’t go on forever.”
“What do you expect to find?” Maysilee asks.
“I don’t know. But maybe there’s something we can use,” he says.
When they finally do make it through that impossible hedge, using a blowtorch from one of the dead Careers’ packs, they find themselves on flat, dry earth that leads to a cliff. Far below, you can see jagged rocks.
“That’s all there is, Haymitch. Let’s go back,” says Maysilee.
“No, I’m staying here,” he says.
“All right. There’s only five of us left. May as well say good-bye now, anyway,” she says. “I don’t want it to come down to you and me.”
“Okay,” he agrees. That’s all. He doesn’t offer to shake her hand or even look at her. And she walks away.
Haymitch skirts along the edge of the cliff as if trying to figure something out. His foot dislodges a pebble and it falls into the abyss, apparently gone forever. But a minute later, as he sits to rest, the pebble shoots back up beside him. Haymitch stares at it, puzzled, and then his face takes on a strange intensity. He lobs a rock the size of his fist over the cliff and waits. When it flies back out and right into his hand, he starts laughing.
That’s when we hear Maysilee begin to scream. The alliance is over and she broke it off, so no one could blame him for ignoring her. But Haymitch runs for her, anyway. He arrives only in time to watch the last of a flock of candy pink birds, equipped with long, thin beaks, skewer her through the neck. He holds her hand while she dies, and all I can think of is Rue and how I was too late to save her, too.
Later that day, another tribute is killed in combat and a third gets eaten by a pack of those fluffy squirrels, leaving Haymitch and a girl from District 1 to vie for the crown. She’s bigger than he is and just as fast, and when the inevitable fight comes, it’s bloody and awful and both have received what could well be fatal wounds, when Haymitch is finally disarmed. He staggers through the beautiful woods, holding his intestines in, while she stumbles after him, carrying the ax that should deliver his deathblow. Haymitch makes a beeline for his cliff and has just reached the edge when she throws the ax. He collapses on the ground and it flies into the abyss. Now weaponless as well, the girl just stands there, trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring from her empty eye socket. She’s thinking perhaps that she can outlast Haymitch, who’s starting to convulse on the ground. But what she doesn’t know, and what he does, is that the ax will return. And when it flies back over the ledge, it buries itself in her head. The cannon sounds, her body is removed, and the trumpets blow to announce Haymitch’s victory.
Peeta clicks off the tape and we sit there in silence for a while.
Finally Peeta says, “That force field at the bottom of the cliff, it was like the one on the roof of the Training Center. The one that throws you back if you try to jump off and commit suicide. Haymitch found a way to turn it into a weapon.”
“Not just against the other tributes, but the Capitol, too,” I say. “You know they didn’t expect that to happen. It wasn’t meant to be part of the arena. They never planned on anyone using it as a weapon. It made them look stupid that he figured it out. I bet they had a good time trying to spin that one. Bet that’s why I don’t remember seeing it on television. It’s almost as bad as us and the berries!”
I can’t help laughing, really laughing, for the first time in months. Peeta just shakes his head like I’ve lost my mind—and maybe I have, a little.
“Almost, but not quite,” says Haymitch from behind us. I whip around, afraid he’s going to be angry over us watching his tape, but he just smirks and takes a swig from a bottle of wine. So much for sobriety. I guess I should be upset he’s drinking again, but I’m preoccupied with another feeling.
I’ve spent all these weeks getting to know who my competitors are, without even thinking about who my teammates are. Now a new kind of confidence is lighting up inside of me, because I think I finally know who Haymitch is. And I’m beginning to know who I am. And surely, two people who have caused the Capitol so much trouble can think of a way to get Peeta home alive."

But I haven’t anticipated the emotional ordeal that awaits me. At some point during the prep, each of them bursts into tears at least twice, and Octavia pretty much keeps up a running whimper throughout the morning. It turns out they really have become attached to me, and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them. Combine that with the fact that by losing me they’ll be losing their ticket to all kinds of big social events, particularly my wedding, and the whole thing becomes unbearable. The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I’m the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.
It’s interesting, though, when I think of what Peeta said about the attendant on the train being unhappy about the victors having to fight again. About people in the Capitol not liking it. I still think all of that will be forgotten once the gong sounds, but it’s something of a revelation that those in the Capitol feel anything at all about us. They certainly don’t have a problem watching children murdered every year. But maybe they know too much about the victors, especially the ones who’ve been celebrities for ages, to forget we’re human beings. It’s more like watching your own friends die. More like the Games are for those of us in the districts."

They go off to recover, thankfully leaving me in Cinna’s hands. He puts up my hair first, in the braided style my mother introduced him to, then proceeds with my makeup. Last year he used little so that the audience would recognize me when I landed in the arena. But now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. High arching eyebrows, sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, deep purple lips. The costume looks deceptively simple at first, just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me from the neck down. He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on my head, but it’s made of a heavy black metal, not gold. Then he adjusts the light in the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on my wrist. I look down, fascinated, as my ensemble slowly comes to life, first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-red of burning coal. I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers—no, that I am a glowing ember straight from our fireplace. The colors rise and fall, shift and blend, in exactly the way the coals do.
“How did you do this?” I say in wonder.
“Portia and I spent a lot of hours watching fires,” says Cinna. “Now look at yourself.”
He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect. I do not see a girl, or even a woman, but some unearthly being who looks like she might make her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitch’s Quell. The black crown, which now appears red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramatically made-up face. Katniss, the girl on fire, has left behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks. She is as deadly as fire itself.
“I think…this is just what I needed to face the others,” I say.
“Yes, I think your days of pink lipstick and ribbons are behind you,” says Cinna. He touches the button on my wrist again, extinguishing my light. “Let’s not run down your power pack.

I’m hoping to find Peeta and Haymitch, but they haven’t arrived yet. Unlike last year, when all the tributes were practically glued to their chariots, the scene is very social. The victors, both this year’s tributes and their mentors, are standing around in small groups, talking. Of course, they all know one another and I don’t know anyone, and I’m not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself.

“Hello, Finnick,” I say, just as casually, although I’m feeling uncomfortable at his closeness, especially since he’s got so much bare skin exposed.

Since he won the Sixty-fifth Hunger Games when he was only fourteen, he’s still one of the youngest victors. Being from District 4, he was a Career, so the odds were already in his favor, but what no trainer could claim to have given him was his extraordinary beauty. Tall, athletic, with golden skin and bronze-colored hair and those incredible eyes. While other tributes that year were hard-pressed to get a handful of grain or some matches for a gift, Finnick never wanted for anything, not food or medicine or weapons. It took about a week for his competitors to realize that he was the one to kill, but it was too late. He was already a good fighter with the spears and knives he had found in the Cornucopia. When he received a silver parachute with a trident—which may be the most expensive gift I’ve ever seen given in the arena—it was all over. District 4’s industry is fishing. He’d been on boats his whole life. The trident was a natural, deadly extension of his arm. He wove a net out of some kind of vine he found, used it to entangle his opponents so he could spear them with the trident, and within a matter of days the crown was his.
The citizens of the Capitol have been drooling over him ever since.
Because of his youth, they couldn’t really touch him for the first year or two. But ever since he turned sixteen, he’s spent his time at the Games being dogged by those desperately in love with him. No one retains his favor for long. He can go through four or five in his annual visit. Old or young, lovely or plain, rich or very rich, he’ll keep them company and take their extravagant gifts, but he never stays, and once he’s gone he never comes back.
I can’t argue that Finnick isn’t one of the most stunning, sensuous people on the planet. But I can honestly say he’s never been attractive to me. Maybe he’s too pretty, or maybe he’s too easy to get, or maybe it’s really that he’d just be too easy to lose.
“No, thanks,” I say to the sugar. “I’d love to borrow your outfit sometime, though.”
He’s draped in a golden net that’s strategically knotted at his groin so that he can’t technically be called naked, but he’s about as close as you can get. I’m sure his stylist thinks the more of Finnick the audience sees, the better.
“You’re absolutely terrifying me in that getup. What happened to the pretty little-girl dresses?” he asks. He wets his lips just ever so slightly with his tongue. Probably this drives most people crazy. But for some reason all I can think of is old Cray, salivating over some poor, starving young woman.

I see him nod in our direction and then they follow him over to greet us.
I know Chaff by sight because I’ve spent years watching him pass a bottle back and forth with Haymitch on television. He’s dark skinned, about six feet tall, and one of his arms ends in a stump because he lost his hand in the Games he won thirty years ago. I’m sure they offered him some artificial replacement, like they did Peeta when they had to amputate his lower leg, but I guess he didn’t take it.
The woman, Seeder, looks almost like she could be from the Seam, with her olive skin and straight black hair streaked with silver. Only her golden brown eyes mark her as from another district. She must be around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there’s no sign she’s turned to liquor or morphling or any other chemical form of escape over the years. Before either of us says a word, she embraces me. I know somehow it must be because of Rue and Thresh. Before I can stop myself, I whisper, “The families?”
“They’re alive,” she says back softly before letting me go.
Chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a big kiss right on the mouth. I jerk back, startled, while he and Haymitch guffaw.
That’s about all the time we get before the Capitol attendants are firmly directing us toward the elevators. I get the distinct feeling they’re not comfortable with the camaraderie among the victors, who couldn’t seem to care less. As I walk toward the elevators, my hand still linked with Peeta’s, someone else rustles up to my side. The girl pulls off a headdress of leafy branches and tosses it behind her without bothering to look where it falls.
Johanna Mason. From District 7. Lumber and paper, thus the tree. She won by very convincingly portraying herself as weak and helpless so that she would be ignored. Then she demonstrated a wicked ability to murder. She ruffles up her spiky hair and rolls her wide-set brown eyes. “Isn’t my costume awful? My stylist’s the biggest idiot in the Capitol. Our tributes have been trees for forty years under her. Wish I’d gotten Cinna. You look fantastic.”
Girl talk. That thing I’ve always been so bad at. Opinions on clothes, hair, makeup. So I lie. “Yeah, he’s been helping me design my own clothing line. You should see what he can do with velvet.” Velvet. The only fabric I could think of off the top of my head.
“I have. On your tour. That strapless number you wore in District Two? The deep blue one with the diamonds? So gorgeous I wanted to reach through the screen and tear it right off your back,” says Johanna.
I bet you did, I think. With a few inches of my flesh.
While we wait for the elevators, Johanna unzips the rest of her tree, letting it drop to the floor, and then kicks it away in disgust. Except for her forest green slippers, she doesn’t have on a stitch of clothing. “That’s better.”
We end up on the same elevator with her, and she spends the whole ride to the seventh floor chatting to Peeta about his paintings while the light of his still-glowing costume reflects off her bare breasts. When she leaves, I ignore him, but I just know he’s grinning. I toss aside his hand as the doors close behind Chaff and Seeder, leaving us alone, and he breaks out laughing.
“What?” I say, turning on him as we step out on our floor.
“It’s you, Katniss. Can’t you see?” he says.
“What’s me?” I say.
“Why they’re all acting like this. Finnick with his sugar cubes and Chaff kissing you and that whole thing with Johanna stripping down.” He tries to take on a more serious tone, unsuccessfully. “They’re playing with you because you’re so…you know.”
“No, I don’t know,” I say. And I really have no idea what he’s talking about.
“It’s like when you wouldn’t look at me naked in the arena even though I was half dead. You’re so…pure,” he says finally.
“I am not!” I say. “I’ve been practically ripping your clothes off every time there’s been a camera for the last year!”

I know any move I would make toward Darius, any act of recognition, would only result in punishment for him. So we just stare into each other’s eyes. Darius, now a mute slave; me, now headed to death. What would we say, anyway? That we’re sorry for the other’s lot? That we ache for the other’s pain? That we’re glad we had the chance to know each other?
No, Darius shouldn’t be glad he knew me. If I had been there to stop Thread, he wouldn’t have stepped forward to save Gale. Wouldn’t be an Avox. And more specifically, wouldn’t be my Avox, because President Snow has so obviously had him placed here for my benefit.

In the bathroom, I wash the dark streaks of makeup from my face. I dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to the dining room.
I’m not aware of much at dinner except that Darius and the redheaded Avox girl are our servers. Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, Portia, and Peeta are all there, talking about the opening ceremonies, I suppose. But the only time I really feel present is when I purposely knock a dish of peas to the floor and, before anyone can stop me, crouch down to clean them up. Darius is right by me when I send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured from view, as we scoop up the peas. For just one moment our hands meet. I can feel his skin, rough under the buttery sauce from the dish. In the tight, desperate clench of our fingers are all the words we will never be able to say. Then Effie’s clucking at me from behind about how “That isn’t your job, Katniss!” and he lets go."

Effie calls a reminder to meet early for breakfast to work out our training strategy, but even her voice sounds hollow. Poor Effie. She finally had a decent year in the Games with Peeta and me, and now it’s all broken down into a mess that even she can’t put a positive spin on. In Capitol terms, I’m guessing this counts as a true tragedy."

The morphlings from District 6 are in the camouflage station, painting each other’s faces with bright pink swirls. The male tribute from District 5 is vomiting wine on the sword-fighting floor. Finnick and the old woman from his district are using the archery station. Johanna Mason is naked again and oiling her skin down for a wrestling lesson. I decide to stay put."

Between her district accent and her garbled speech—possibly she’s had a stroke—I can’t make out more than one in four words. But I swear she can make a decent fishhook out of anything—a thorn, a wishbone, an earring. After a while I tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does. When I make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair, she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might be praise. Suddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young, hysterical woman in her district. It couldn’t be because she thought she had any chance of winning. She did it to save the girl, just like I volunteered last year to save Prim. And I decide I want her on my team.
Great. Now I have to go back and tell Haymitch I want an eighty-year-old and Nuts and Volts for my allies. He’ll love that.

It’s wonderful there, getting to try out all the different bows and arrows. The trainer, Tax, seeing that the standing targets offer no challenge for me, begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit. At first it seems stupid, but it turns out to be kind of fun. Much more like hunting a moving creature. Since I’m hitting everything he throws up, he starts increasing the number of birds he sends airborne. I forget the rest of the gym and the victors and how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting. When I manage to take down five birds in one round, I realize it’s so quiet I can hear each one hit the floor. I turn and see the majority of the victors have stopped to watch me. Their faces show everything from envy to hatred to admiration.
After training, Peeta and I hang out, waiting for Haymitch and Effie to show up for dinner. When we’re called to eat, Haymitch pounces on me immediately. “So at least half the victors have instructed their mentors to request you as an ally. I know it can’t be your sunny personality.”
“They saw her shoot,” says Peeta with a smile. “Actually, I saw her shoot, for real, for the first time. I’m about to put in a formal request myself.”
“You’re that good?” Haymitch asks me. “So good that Brutus wants you?”
I shrug. “But I don’t want Brutus. I want Mags and District Three.”
“Of course you do.” Haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. “I’ll tell everybody you’re still making up your mind.”
After my shooting exhibition, I still get teased some, but I no longer feel like I’m being mocked. In fact, I feel as if I’ve somehow been initiated into the victors’ circle. During the next two days, I spend time with almost everybody headed for the arena. Even the morphlings, who, with Peeta’s help, paint me into a field of yellow flowers. Even Finnick, who gives me an hour of trident lessons in exchange for an hour of archery instruction. And the more I come to know these people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don’t hate them. And some I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would be to protect them. But all of them must die if I’m to save Peeta."

We each get fifteen minutes before the Gamemakers to amaze them with our skills, but I don’t know what any of us might have to show them. There’s a lot of kidding about it at lunch. What we might do. Sing, dance, strip, tell jokes. Mags, who I can understand a little better now, decides she’s just going to take a nap. I don’t know what I’m going to do. Shoot some arrows, I guess. Haymitch said to surprise them if we could, but I’m fresh out of ideas."

When I go in, I smell the sharp odor of cleaner and notice that one of the mats has been dragged to the center of the room. The mood is very different from last year’s, when the Gamemakers were half drunk and distractedly picking at tidbits from the banquet table. They whisper among themselves, looking somewhat annoyed. What did Peeta do? Something to upset them?
I feel a pang of worry. That isn’t good. I don’t want Peeta singling himself out as a target for the Gamemakers’ anger. That’s part of my job. To draw fire away from Peeta. But how did he upset them? Because I’d love to do just that and more. To break through the smug veneer of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us. To make them realize that while we’re vulnerable to the Capitol’s cruelties, they are as well.
Do you have any idea how much I hate you? I think. You, who have given your talents to the Games?
I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbee’s eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as he has the entire training period. I remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. His friendly manner has no place here. How could it, when I’m a mere tribute and he’s the Head Gamemaker? So powerful, so removed, so safe…
Suddenly I know just what I’m going to do. Something that will blow anything Peeta did right out of the water. I go over to the knot-tying station and get a length of rope. I start to manipulate it, but it’s hard because I’ve never made this actual knot myself. I’ve only watched Finnick’s clever fingers, and they moved so fast. After about ten minutes, I’ve come up with a respectable noose. I drag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and, using some chinning bars, hang it so it dangles by the neck. Tying its hands behind its back would be a nice touch, but I think I might be running out of time. I hurry over to the camouflage station, where some of the other tributes, undoubtedly the morphlings, have made a colossal mess. But I find a partial container of bloodred berry juice that will serve my needs. The flesh-colored fabric of the dummy’s skin makes a good, absorbent canvas. I carefully finger paint the words on its body, concealing them from view. Then I step away quickly to watch the reaction on the Gamemakers’ faces as they read the name on the dummy.
SENECA CRANE."
highlight,Catching Fire,Suzanne Collins,2023-12-16T21:33:54.538,2023-12-16T21:35:48Z,,"The effect on the Gamemakers is immediate and satisfying. Several let out small shrieks. Others lose their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter musically against the ground. Two seem to be considering fainting. The look of shock is unanimous.
Now I have Plutarch Heavensbee’s attention. He stares steadily at me as the juice from the peach he crushed in his hand runs through his fingers. Finally he clears his throat and says, “You may go now, Miss Everdeen.”
I give a respectful nod and turn to go, but at the last moment I can’t resist tossing the container of berry juice over my shoulder. I can hear the contents splatter against the dummy while a couple more wineglasses break. As the elevator doors close before me, I see no one has moved.
That surprised them, I think. It was rash and dangerous and no doubt I will pay for it ten times over. But for the moment, I feel something close to elation and I let myself savor it.
I want to find Haymitch immediately and tell him about my session, but no one’s around. I guess they’re getting ready for dinner and I decide to go take a shower myself, since my hands are stained from the juice. As I stand in the water, I begin to wonder about the wisdom of my latest trick. The question that should now always be my guide is “Will this help Peeta stay alive?” Indirectly, this might not. What happens in training is highly secretive, so there’s no point in taking action against me when no one will know what my transgression was. In fact, last year I was rewarded for my brashness. This is a different sort of crime, though. If the Gamemakers are angry with me and decide to punish me in the arena, Peeta could get caught up in the attack as well. Maybe it was too impulsive. Still…I can’t say I’m sorry I did it.
As we all gather for dinner, I notice Peeta’s hands are faintly stained with a variety of colors, even though his hair is still damp from bathing. He must have done some form of camouflage after all. Once the soup is served, Haymitch gets right to the issue on everyone’s mind. “All right, so how did your private sessions go?”
I exchange a look with Peeta. Somehow I’m not that eager to put what I did into words. In the calm of the dining room, it seems very extreme. “You first,” I say to him. “It must have been really special. I had to wait for forty minutes to go in.”
Peeta seems to be struck with the same reluctance I’m experiencing. “Well, I—I did the camouflage thing, like you suggested, Katniss.” He hesitates. “Not exactly camouflage. I mean, I used the dyes.”
“To do what?” asks Portia.
I think of how ruffled the Gamemakers were when I entered the gym for my session. The smell of cleaners. The mat pulled over that spot in the center of the gym. Was it to conceal something they were unable to wash away? “You painted something, didn’t you? A picture.”
“Did you see it?” Peeta asks.
“No. But they’d made a real point of covering it up,” I say.
“Well, that would be standard. They can’t let one tribute know what another did,” says Effie, unconcerned. “What did you paint, Peeta?” She looks a little misty. “Was it a picture of Katniss?”
“Why would he paint a picture of me, Effie?” I ask, somehow annoyed.
“To show he’s going to do everything he can to defend you. That’s what everyone in the Capitol’s expecting, anyway. Didn’t he volunteer to go in with you?” Effie says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
“Actually, I painted a picture of Rue,” Peeta says. “How she looked after Katniss had covered her in flowers.”
There’s a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this. “And what exactly were you trying to accomplish?” Haymitch asks in a very measured voice.
“I’m not sure. I just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,” says Peeta. “For killing that little girl.”
“This is dreadful.” Effie sounds like she’s about to cry. “That sort of thinking…it’s forbidden, Peeta. Absolutely. You’ll only bring down more trouble on yourself and Katniss.”
“I have to agree with Effie on this one,” says Haymitch. Portia and Cinna remain silent, but their faces are very serious. Of course, they’re right. But even though it worries me, I think what he did was amazing.
“I guess this is a bad time to mention I hung a dummy and painted Seneca Crane’s name on it,” I say. This has the desired effect. After a moment of disbelief, all the disapproval in the room hits me like a ton of bricks.
“You…hung…Seneca Crane?” says Cinna.
“Yes. I was showing off my new knot-tying skills, and he somehow ended up at the end of the noose,” I say.
“Oh, Katniss,” says Effie in a hushed voice. “How do you even know about that?”
“Is it a secret? President Snow didn’t act like it was. In fact, he seemed eager for me to know,” I say. Effie leaves the table with her napkin pressed to her face. “Now I’ve upset Effie. I should have lied and said I shot some arrows.”
“You’d have thought we planned it,” says Peeta, giving me just the hint of a smile.
“Didn’t you?” asks Portia. Her fingers press her eyelids closed as if she’s warding off a very bright light.
“No,” I say, looking at Peeta with a new sense of appreciation. “Neither of us even knew what we were going to do before we went in.”
“And, Haymitch?” says Peeta. “We decided we don’t want any other allies in the arena.”
“Good. Then I won’t be responsible for you killing off any of my friends with your stupidity,” he says.
“That’s just what we were thinking,” I tell him.
We finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room, Cinna puts his arm around me and gives me a squeeze. “Come on and let’s go get those training scores.”
We gather around the television set and a red-eyed Effie rejoins us. The tributes’ faces come up, district by district, and their scores flash under their pictures. One through twelve. Predictably high scores for Cashmere, Gloss, Brutus, Enobaria, and Finnick. Low to medium for the rest.
“Have they ever given a zero?” I ask.
“No, but there’s a first time for everything,” Cinna answers.
And it turns out he’s right. Because when Peeta and I each pull a twelve, we make Hunger Games history. No one feels like celebrating, though.
“Why did they do that?” I ask.
“So that the others will have no choice but to target you,” says Haymitch flatly. “Go to bed. I can’t stand to look at either one of you.”

“No worse than I did. Why did you do it, anyway?” he says.
“I don’t know. To show them that I’m more than just a piece in their Games?” I say.
He laughs a little, no doubt remembering the night before the Games last year. We were on the roof, neither of us able to sleep. Peeta had said something of the sort then, but I hadn’t understood what he meant. Now I do.
“Me, too,” he tells me. “And I’m not saying I’m not going to try. To get you home, I mean. But if I’m perfectly honest about it…”
“If you’re perfectly honest about it, you think President Snow has probably given them direct orders to make sure we die in the arena anyway,” I say.
“It’s crossed my mind,” says Peeta.
It’s crossed my mind, too. Repeatedly. But while I know I’ll never leave that arena alive, I’m still holding on to the hope that Peeta will. After all, he didn’t pull out those berries, I did. No one has ever doubted that Peeta’s defiance was motivated by love. So maybe President Snow will prefer keeping him alive, crushed and heartbroken, as a living warning to others.
“But even if that happens, everyone will know we’ve gone out fighting, right?” Peeta asks.
“Everyone will,” I reply. And for the first time, I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I remember the old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumored uprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow’s dominance. They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I can make it clear that I’m still defying the Capitol right up to the end, the Capitol will have killed me…but not my spirit. What better way to give hope to the rebels?
The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitol’s rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one. And if I really could save Peeta…in terms of a revolution, this would be ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be more valuable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people."

It feels like such a luxury, sleeping with Peeta again. I didn’t realize until now how starved I’ve been for human closeness. For the feel of him beside me in the darkness. I wish I hadn’t wasted the last couple of nights shutting him out. I sink down into sleep, enveloped in his warmth, and when I open my eyes again, daylight’s streaming through the windows.

More high heels and sarcastic comments, I think. But then the redheaded Avox girl comes in with a note from Effie saying that, given our recent tour, both she and Haymitch have agreed we can handle ourselves adequately in public. The coaching sessions have been canceled.
“Really?” says Peeta, taking the note from my hand and examining it. “Do you know what this means? We’ll have the whole day to ourselves.”
“It’s too bad we can’t go somewhere,” I say wistfully.
“Who says we can’t?” he asks.
The roof. We order a bunch of food, grab some blankets, and head up to the roof for a picnic. A daylong picnic in the flower garden that tinkles with wind chimes. We eat. We lie in the sun. I snap off hanging vines and use my newfound knowledge from training to practice knots and weave nets. Peeta sketches me. We make up a game with the force field that surrounds the roof—one of us throws an apple into it and the other person has to catch it.
No one bothers us. By late afternoon, I lie with my head on Peeta’s lap, making a crown of flowers while he fiddles with my hair, claiming he’s practicing his knots. After a while, his hands go still. “What?” I ask.
“I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever,” he says.
Usually this sort of comment, the kind that hints of his undying love for me, makes me feel guilty and awful. But I feel so warm and relaxed and beyond worrying about a future I’ll never have, I just let the word slip out. “Okay.”
I can hear the smile in his voice. “Then you’ll allow it?”
“I’ll allow it,” I say.
His fingers go back to my hair and I doze off, but he rouses me to see the sunset. It’s a spectacular yellow and orange blaze behind the skyline of the Capitol. “I didn’t think you’d want to miss it,” he says.
“Thanks,” I say. Because I can count on my fingers the number of sunsets I have left, and I don’t want to miss any of them.
We don’t go and join the others for dinner, and no one summons us.
“I’m glad. I’m tired of making everyone around me so miserable,” says Peeta. “Everybody crying. Or Haymitch…” He doesn’t need to go on.
We stay on the roof until bedtime and then quietly slip down to my room without encountering anyone.

“President Snow put in the dress order himself,” says Cinna. He unzips the bag, revealing one of the wedding dresses I wore for the photo shoot. Heavy white silk with a low neckline and tight waist and sleeves that fall from my wrists to the floor. And pearls. Everywhere pearls. Stitched into the dress and in ropes at my throat and forming the crown for the veil. “Even though they announced the Quarter Quell the night of the photo shoot, people still voted for their favorite dress, and this was the winner. The president says you’re to wear it tonight. Our objections were ignored.”
I rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out President Snow’s reasoning. I suppose since I was the greatest offender, my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight. This, he thinks, will make that clear. It’s so barbaric, the president turning my bridal gown into my shroud, that the blow strikes home, leaving me with a dull ache inside. “Well, it’d be a shame to waste such a pretty dress” is all I say.
Cinna helps me carefully into the gown. As it settles on my shoulders, they can’t help giving a shrug of complaint. “Was it always this heavy?” I ask. I remember several of the dresses being dense, but this one feels like it weighs a ton.
“I had to make some slight alterations because of the lighting,” says Cinna. I nod, but I can’t see what that has to do with anything. He decks me out in the shoes and the pearl jewelry and the veil. Touches up my makeup. Has me walk.
“You’re ravishing,” he says. “Now, Katniss, because this bodice is so fitted, I don’t want you raising your arms above your head. Well, not until you twirl, anyway.”
“Will I be twirling again?” I ask, thinking of my dress last year.
“I’m sure Caesar will ask you. And if he doesn’t, you suggest it yourself. Only not right away. Save it for your big finale,” Cinna instructs me.

Back home everything is so much simpler. A woman usually rents a white dress that’s been worn hundreds of times. The man wears something clean that’s not mining clothes. They fill out some forms at the Justice Building and are assigned a house. Family and friends gather for a meal or bit of cake, if it can be afforded. Even if it can’t, there’s always a traditional song we sing as the new couple crosses the threshold of their home. And we have our own little ceremony, where they make their first fire, toast a bit of bread, and share it. Maybe it’s old-fashioned, but no one really feels married in District 12 until after the toasting."

I realize everyone’s staring daggers at my wedding dress. Are they jealous of its beauty? The power it might have to manipulate the crowd?
Finally Finnick says, “I can’t believe Cinna put you in that thing.”
“He didn’t have any choice. President Snow made him,” I say, somewhat defensively. I won’t let anyone criticize Cinna.
Cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out, “Well, you look ridiculous!” She grabs her brother’s hand and pulls him into place to lead our procession onto the stage. The other tributes begin to line up as well. I’m confused because, while they all are angry, some are giving us sympathetic pats on the shoulder, and Johanna Mason actually stops to straighten my pearl necklace.
“Make him pay for it, okay?” she says.
I nod, but I don’t know what she means. Not until we’re all sitting out onstage and Caesar Flickerman, hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their interviews. This is the first time I realize the depth of betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that accompanies it. But they are so smart, so wonderfully smart about how they play it, because it all comes back to reflect on the government and President Snow in particular. Not everyone. There are the old throwbacks, like Brutus and Enobaria, who are just here for another Games, and those too baffled or drugged or lost to join in on the attack. But there are enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve to come out fighting.
Cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about how she just can’t stop crying when she thinks of how much the people in the Capitol must be suffering because they will lose us. Gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister. Beetee questions the legality of the Quell in his nervous, twitchy way, wondering if it’s been fully examined by experts of late. Finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the Capitol, and about a hundred people faint because they’re sure he means them. By the time Johanna Mason gets up, she’s asking if something can’t be done about the situation. Surely the creators of the Quarter Quell never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the Capitol. No one could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. Seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in District 11, everyone assumes President Snow is all-powerful. So if he’s all-powerful, why doesn’t he change the Quell? And Chaff, who comes right on her heels, insists the president could change the Quell if he wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to anyone."

People have been weeping and collapsing and even calling for change. The sight of me in my white silk bridal gown practically causes a riot. No more me, no more star-crossed lovers living happily ever after, no more wedding. I can see even Caesar’s professionalism showing some cracks as he tries to quiet them so I can speak, but my three minutes are ticking quickly away.
Finally there’s a lull and he gets out, “So, Katniss, obviously this is a very emotional night for everyone. Is there anything you’d like to say?”
My voice trembles as I speak. “Only that I’m so sorry you won’t get to be at my wedding…but I’m glad you at least get to see me in my dress. Isn’t it just…the most beautiful thing?” I don’t have to look at Cinna for a signal. I know this is the right time. I begin to twirl slowly, raising the sleeves of my heavy gown above my head.
When I hear the screams of the crowd, I think it’s because I must look stunning. Then I notice something is rising up around me. Smoke. From fire. Not the flickery stuff I wore last year in the chariot, but something much more real that devours my dress. I begin to panic as the smoke thickens. Charred bits of black silk swirl into the air, and pearls clatter to the stage. Somehow I’m afraid to stop because my flesh doesn’t seem to be burning and I know Cinna must be behind whatever is happening. So I keep spinning and spinning. For a split second I’m gasping, completely engulfed in the strange flames. Then all at once, the fire is gone. I slowly come to a stop, wondering if I’m naked and why Cinna has arranged to burn away my wedding dress.
But I’m not naked. I’m in a dress of the exact design of my wedding dress, only it’s the color of coal and made of tiny feathers. Wonderingly, I lift my long, flowing sleeves into the air, and that’s when I see myself on the television screen. Clothed in black except for the white patches on my sleeves. Or should I say my wings.
Because Cinna has turned me into a mockingjay."

Caesar and Peeta have been a natural team since they first appeared together a year ago. Their easy give-and-take, comic timing, and ability to segue into heart-wrenching moments, like Peeta’s confession of love for me, have made them a huge success with the audience. They effortlessly open with a few jokes about fires and feathers and overcooking poultry. But anyone can see that Peeta is preoccupied, so Caesar directs the conversation right into the subject that’s on everyone’s minds.
“So, Peeta, what was it like when, after all you’ve been through, you found out about the Quell?” asks Caesar.
“I was in shock. I mean, one minute I’m seeing Katniss looking so beautiful in all these wedding gowns, and the next…” Peeta trails off.
“You realized there was never going to be a wedding?” asks Caesar gently.
Peeta pauses for a long moment, as if deciding something. He looks out at the spellbound audience, then at the floor, then finally up at Caesar. “Caesar, do you think all our friends here can keep a secret?”
An uncomfortable laugh emanates from the audience. What can he mean? Keep a secret from who? Our whole world is watching.
“I feel quite certain of it,” says Caesar.
“We’re already married,” says Peeta quietly. The crowd reacts in astonishment, and I have to bury my face in the folds of my skirt so they can’t see my confusion. Where on earth is he going with this?
“But…how can that be?” asks Caesar.
“Oh, it’s not an official marriage. We didn’t go to the Justice Building or anything. But we have this marriage ritual in District Twelve. I don’t know what it’s like in the other districts. But there’s this thing we do,” says Peeta, and he briefly describes the toasting.
“Were your families there?” asks Caesar.
“No, we didn’t tell anyone. Not even Haymitch. And Katniss’s mother would never have approved. But you see, we knew if we were married in the Capitol, there wouldn’t be a toasting. And neither of us really wanted to wait any longer. So one day, we just did it,” Peeta says. “And to us, we’re more married than any piece of paper or big party could make us.”
“So this was before the Quell?” says Caesar.
“Of course before the Quell. I’m sure we’d never have done it after we knew,” says Peeta, starting to get upset. “But who could’ve seen it coming? No one. We went through the Games, we were victors, everyone seemed so thrilled to see us together, and then out of nowhere—I mean, how could we anticipate a thing like that?”
“You couldn’t, Peeta.” Caesar puts an arm around his shoulders. “As you say, no one could’ve. But I have to confess, I’m glad you two had at least a few months of happiness together.”
Enormous applause. As if encouraged, I look up from my feathers and let the audience see my tragic smile of thanks. The residual smoke from the feathers has made my eyes teary, which adds a very nice touch.
“I’m not glad,” says Peeta. “I wish we had waited until the whole thing was done officially.”
This takes even Caesar aback. “Surely even a brief time is better than no time?”
“Maybe I’d think that, too, Caesar,” says Peeta bitterly, “if it weren’t for the baby.”
There. He’s done it again. Dropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of every tribute who came before him. Well, maybe not. Maybe this year he has only lit the fuse on a bomb that the victors themselves have been building. Hoping someone would be able to detonate it. Perhaps thinking it would be me in my bridal gown. Not knowing how much I rely on Cinna’s talents, whereas Peeta needs nothing more than his wits.
As the bomb explodes, it sends accusations of injustice and barbarism and cruelty flying out in every direction. Even the most Capitol-loving, Games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out there can’t ignore, at least for a moment, how horrific the whole thing is.
I am pregnant.
The audience can’t absorb the news right away. It has to strike them and sink in and be confirmed by other voices before they begin to sound like a herd of wounded animals, moaning, shrieking, calling for help. And me? I know my face is projected in a tight close-up on the screen, but I don’t make any effort to hide it. Because for a moment, even I am working through what Peeta has said. Isn’t it the thing I dreaded most about the wedding, about the future—the loss of my children to the Games? And it could be true now, couldn’t it? If I hadn’t spent my life building up layers of defenses until I recoil at even the suggestion of marriage or a family?
Caesar can’t rein in the crowd again, not even when the buzzer sounds. Peeta nods his good-bye and comes back to his seat without any more conversation. I can see Caesar’s lips moving, but the place is in total chaos and I can’t hear a word. Only the blast of the anthem, cranked up so loud I can feel it vibrating through my bones, lets us know where we stand in the program. I automatically rise and, as I do, I sense Peeta reaching out for me. Tears run down his face as I take his hand. How real are the tears? Is this an acknowledgment that he has been stalked by the same fears that I have? That every victor has? Every parent in every district in Panem?
I look back to the crowd, but the faces of Rue’s mother and father swim before my eyes. Their sorrow. Their loss. I turn spontaneously to Chaff and offer my hand. I feel my fingers close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast.
And then it happens. Up and down the row, the victors begin to join hands. Some right away, like the morphlings, or Wiress and Beetee. Others unsure but caught up in the demands of those around them, like Brutus and Enobaria. By the time the anthem plays its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity among the districts since the Dark Days. You can see the realization of this as the screens begin to pop into blackness. It’s too late, though. In the confusion they didn’t cut us off in time. Everyone has seen.
There’s disorder on the stage now, too, as the lights go out and we’re left to stumble back into the Training Center. I’ve lost hold of Chaff, but Peeta guides me into an elevator. Finnick and Johanna try to join us, but a harried Peacekeeper blocks their way and we shoot upward alone.
The moment we step off the elevator, Peeta grips my shoulders. “There isn’t much time, so tell me. Is there anything I have to apologize for?”
“Nothing,” I say. It was a big leap to take without my okay, but I’m just as glad I didn’t know, didn’t have time to second-guess him, to let any guilt over Gale detract from how I really feel about what Peeta did. Which is empowered.
Somewhere, very far off, is a place called District 12, where my mother and sister and friends will have to deal with the fallout from this night. Just a brief hovercraft ride away is an arena where, tomorrow, Peeta and I and the other tributes will face our own form of punishment. But even if all of us meet terrible ends, something happened on that stage tonight that can’t be undone. We victors staged our own uprising, and maybe, just maybe, the Capitol won’t be able to contain this one."

So, once again, I let Peeta speak for us both.
“You take care, Haymitch,” he says.
We cross the room, but in the doorway, Haymitch’s voice stops us. “Katniss, when you’re in the arena,” he begins. Then he pauses. He’s scowling in a way that makes me sure I’ve already disappointed him.
“What?” I ask defensively.
“You just remember who the enemy is,” Haymitch tells me. “That’s all. Now go on. Get out of here.”"

Finnick, glistening and gorgeous, stands a few yards away, with a trident poised to attack. A net dangles from his other hand. He’s smiling a little, but the muscles in his upper body are rigid in anticipation. “You can swim, too,” he says. “Where did you learn that in District Twelve?”
“We have a big bathtub,” I answer.
“You must,” he says. “You like the arena?”
“Not particularly. But you should. They must have built it especially for you,” I say with an edge of bitterness. It seems like it, anyway, with all the water, when I bet only a handful of the victors can swim. And there was no pool in the Training Center, no chance to learn. Either you came in here a swimmer or you’d better be a really fast learner. Even participation in the initial bloodbath depends on being able to cover twenty yards of water. That gives District 4 an enormous advantage.
For a moment we’re frozen, sizing each other up, our weapons, our skill. Then Finnick suddenly grins. “Lucky thing we’re allies. Right?”
Sensing a trap, I’m about to let my arrow fly, hoping it finds his heart before the trident impales me, when he shifts his hand and something on his wrist catches the sunlight. A solid-gold bangle patterned with flames. The same one I remember on Haymitch’s wrist the morning I began training. I briefly consider that Finnick could have stolen it to trick me, but somehow I know this isn’t the case. Haymitch gave it to him. As a signal to me. An order, really. To trust Finnick.
I can hear other footsteps approaching. I must decide at once. “Right!” I snap, because even though Haymitch is my mentor and trying to keep me alive, this angers me. Why didn’t he tell me he’d made this arrangement before? Probably because Peeta and I had ruled out allies. Now Haymitch has chosen one on his own.
“Duck!” Finnick commands in such a powerful voice, so different from his usual seductive purr, that I do. His trident goes whizzing over my head and there’s a sickening sound of impact as it finds its target. The man from District 5, the drunk who threw up on the sword-fighting floor, sinks to his knees as Finnick frees the trident from his chest. "

“Yes. Just as Haymitch intended,” I answer.
“Remind me, did we make deals with anyone else?” Peeta asks.
“Only Mags, I think,” I say. I nod toward the old woman doggedly making her way toward us.
“Well, I can’t leave Mags behind,” says Finnick. “She’s one of the few people who actually likes me.”
“I’ve got no problem with Mags,” I say. “Especially now that I see the arena. Her fishhooks are probably our best chance of getting a meal.”
“Katniss wanted her on the first day,” says Peeta.
“Katniss has remarkably good judgment,” says Finnick. With one hand he reaches into the water and scoops out Mags like she weighs no more than a puppy. She makes some remark that I think includes the word “bob,” then pats her belt.
“Look, she’s right. Someone figured it out.” Finnick points to Beetee. He’s flailing around in the waves but managing to keep his head above water.
“What?” I say.
“The belts. They’re flotation devices,” says Finnick. “I mean, you have to propel yourself, but they’ll keep you from drowning.”
I almost ask Finnick to wait, to get Beetee and "

The thin blue fabric of my jumpsuit lets the seawater evaporate easily, but it’s already begun to cling to me with sweat.
Peeta takes the lead, cutting through the patches of dense vegetation with his long knife. I make Finnick go second because even though he’s the most powerful, he’s got his hands full with Mags. Besides, while he’s a whiz with that trident, it’s a weapon less suited to the jungle than my arrows. It doesn’t take long, between the steep incline and the heat, to become short of breath. Peeta and I have been training intensely, though, and Finnick’s such an amazing physical specimen that even with Mags over his shoulder, we climb rapidly for about a mile before he requests a rest. And then I think it’s more for Mags’s sake than his own.
The foliage has hidden the wheel from sight, so I scale a tree with rubbery limbs to get a better view. And then wish that I hadn’t.
Around the Cornucopia, the ground appears to be bleeding; the water has purple stains. Bodies lie on the ground and float in the sea, but at this distance, with everyone dressed exactly the same, I can’t tell who lives or dies. All I can tell is that some of the tiny blue figures still battle. Well, what did I think? That the victors’ chain of locked hands last night would result in some sort of universal truce in the arena? No, I never believed that. But I guess I had hoped people might show some…what? Restraint? Reluctance, at least. Before they jumped right into massacre mode. And you all knew each other, I think. You acted like friends.
I have only one real friend in here. And he isn’t from District 4.
I let the slight, soupy breeze cool my cheeks while I come to a decision. Despite the bangle, I should just get it over with and shoot Finnick. There’s really no future in this alliance. And he’s too dangerous to let go. Now, when we have this tentative trust, may be my only chance to kill him. I could easily shoot him in the back as we walk. It’s despicable, of course, but will it be any more despicable if I wait? Know him better? Owe him more? No, this is the time. I take one last look at the battling figures, the bloody ground, to harden my resolve, and then slide to the ground.
But when I land, I find Finnick’s kept pace with my thoughts. As if he knows what I have seen and how it will have affected me. He has one of his tridents raised in a casually defensive position.
“What’s going on down there, Katniss? Have they all joined hands? Taken a vow of nonviolence? Tossed the weapons in the sea in defiance of the Capitol?” Finnick asks.
“No,” I say.
“No,” Finnick repeats. “Because whatever happened in the past is in the past. And no one in this arena was a victor by chance.” He eyes Peeta for a moment. “Except maybe Peeta.”
Finnick knows then what Haymitch and I know. About Peeta. Being truly, deep-down better than the rest of us. Finnick took out that tribute from 5 without blinking an eye. And how long did I take to turn deadly? I shot to kill when I targeted Enobaria and Gloss and Brutus. Peeta would at least have attempted negotiations first. Seen if some wider alliance was possible. But to what end? Finnick’s right. I’m right. The people in this arena weren’t crowned for their compassion."

The time it will take to send an arrow through his brain versus the time his trident will reach my body. I can see him, waiting for me to make the first move. Calculating if he should block first or go directly for an attack. I can feel we’ve both about worked it out when Peeta steps deliberately between us.
“So how many are dead?” he asks.
Move, you idiot, I think. But he remains planted firmly between us.
“Hard to say,” I answer. “At least six, I think. And they’re still fighting.”
“Let’s keep moving. We need water,” he says.
So far there’s been no sign of a freshwater stream or pond, and the saltwater’s undrinkable. Again, I think of the last Games, where I nearly died of dehydration.
“Better find some soon,” says Finnick. “We need to be undercover when the others come hunting us tonight.”
We. Us. Hunting. All right, maybe killing Finnick would be a little premature. He’s been helpful so far. He does have Haymitch’s stamp of approval. And who knows what the night will hold? If worse comes to worst, I can always kill him in his sleep. So I let the moment pass. And so does Finnick.
The absence of water intensifies my thirst. I keep a sharp eye out as we continue our trek upward, but with no luck. After about another mile, I can see an end to the tree line and assume we’re reaching the crest of the hill. “Maybe we’ll have better luck on the other side. Find a spring or something.”
But there is no other side. I know this before anyone else, even though I am farthest from the top. My eyes catch on a funny, rippling square hanging like a warped pane of glass in the air. At first I think it’s the glare from the sun or the heat shimmering up off the ground. But it’s fixed in space, not shifting when I move. And that’s when I connect the square with Wiress and Beetee in the Training Center and realize what lies before us. My warning cry is just reaching my lips when Peeta’s knife swings out to slash away some vines.
There’s a sharp zapping sound. For an instant, the trees are gone and I see open space over a short stretch of bare earth. Then Peeta’s flung back from the force field, bringing Finnick and Mags to the ground.
I rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. “Peeta?” There’s a faint smell of singed hair. I call his name again, giving him a little shake, but he’s unresponsive. My fingers fumble across his lips, where there’s no warm breath although moments ago he was panting. I press my ear against his chest, to the spot where I always rest my head, where I know I will hear the strong and steady beat of his heart.
Instead, I find silence."
highlight,Catching Fire,Suzanne Collins,2023-12-16T21:55:31.490,2023-12-16T21:55:31Z,,"There’s a force field up ahead.”
I laugh, but there are tears running down my cheeks.
“Must be a lot stronger than the one on the Training Center roof,” he says. “I’m all right, though. Just a little shaken.”
“You were dead! Your heart stopped!” I burst out, before really considering if this is a good idea. I clap my hand over my mouth because I’m starting to make those awful choking sounds that happen when I sob.
“Well, it seems to be working now,” he says. “It’s all right, Katniss.” I nod my head but the sounds aren’t stopping. “Katniss?” Now Peeta’s worried about me, which adds to the insanity of it all.
“It’s okay. It’s just her hormones,” says Finnick. “From the baby.” I look up and see him, sitting back on his knees but still panting a bit from the climb and the heat and the effort of bringing Peeta back from the dead.
“No. It’s not—” I get out, but I’m cut off by an even more hysterical round of sobbing that seems only to confirm what Finnick said about the baby. He meets my eyes and I glare at him through my tears. It’s stupid, I know, that his efforts make me so vexed. All I wanted was to keep Peeta alive, and I couldn’t and Finnick could, and I should be nothing but grateful. And I am. But I am also furious because it means that I will never stop owing Finnick Odair. Ever. So how can I kill him in his sleep?
I expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his face, but his look is strangely quizzical. He glances between Peeta and me, as if trying to figure something out, then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it. “How are you?” he asks Peeta. “Do you think you can move on?”
“No, he has to rest,” I say. My nose is running like crazy and I don’t even have a shred of fabric to use as a handkerchief. Mags rips off a handful of hanging moss from a tree limb and gives it to me. I’m too much of a mess to even question it. I blow my nose loudly and mop the tears off my face. It’s nice, the moss. Absorbent and surprisingly soft"

“I don’t think that’s an option,” Peeta answers. “Staying here. With no water. No protection. I feel all right, really. If we could just go slowly.”
“Slowly would be better than not at all.” Finnick helps Peeta to his feet while I pull myself together. Since I got up this morning I’ve watched Cinna beaten to a pulp, landed in another arena, and seen Peeta die. Still, I’m glad Finnick keeps playing the pregnancy card for me, because from a sponsor’s point of view, I’m not handling things all that well.
I check over my weapons, which I know are in perfect condition, because it makes me seem more in control. “I’ll take the lead,” I announce.
Peeta starts to object but Finnick cuts him off. “No, let her do it.” He frowns at me. “You knew that force field was there, didn’t you? Right at the last second? You started to give a warning.” I nod. “How did you know?”
I hesitate. To reveal that I know Beetee and Wiress’s trick of recognizing a force field could be dangerous. I don’t know if the Gamemakers made note of that moment during training when the two pointed it out to me or not. One way or the other, I have a very valuable piece of information. And if they know I have it, they might do something to alter the force field so I can’t see the aberration anymore. So I lie. “I don’t know. It’s almost as if I could hear it. Listen.” We all become still. There’s the sound of insects, birds, the breeze in the foliage.
“I don’t hear anything,” says Peeta.
“Yes,” I insist, “it’s like when the fence around District Twelve is on, only much, much quieter.” Everyone listens again intently. I do, too, although there’s nothing to hear. “There!” I say. “Can’t you hear it? It’s coming from right where Peeta got shocked.”
“I don’t hear it, either,” says Finnick. “But if you do, by all means, take the lead.”
I decide to play this for all it’s worth. “That’s weird,” I say. I turn my head from side to side as if puzzled. “I can only hear it out of my left ear.”
“The one the doctors reconstructed?” asks Peeta.
“Yeah,” I say, then give a shrug. “Maybe they did a better job than they thought. You know, sometimes I do hear funny things on that side. Things you wouldn’t ordinarily think have a sound. Like insect wings. Or snow hitting the ground.” Perfect. Now all the attention will turn to the surgeons who fixed my deaf ear after the Games last year, and they’ll have to explain why I can hear like a bat.

It could be poisonous.”
She mumbles something and ignores me, licking her lips with apparent relish. I look to Finnick for help but he just laughs. “I guess we’ll find out,” he says.
I go forward, wondering about Finnick, who saved old Mags but will let her eat strange nuts. Who Haymitch has stamped with his seal of approval. Who brought Peeta back from the dead. Why didn’t he just let him die? He would have been blameless. I never would have guessed it was in his power to revive him. Why could he possibly have wanted to save Peeta? And why was he so determined to team up with me? Willing to kill me, too, if it comes to that. But leaving the choice of if we fight to me."

I stop and look back at Mags’s limping form, the sheen of sweat on Peeta’s face. “Let’s take a break,” I say. “I need to get another look from above.”
The tree I choose seems to jut higher into the air than the others. I make my way up the twisting boughs, staying as close to the trunk as possible. No telling how easily these rubbery branches will snap. Still I climb beyond good sense because there’s something I have to see. As I cling to a stretch of trunk no wider than a sapling, swaying back and forth in the humid breeze, my suspicions are confirmed. There’s a reason we can’t turn to the left, will never be able to. From this precarious vantage point, I can see the shape of the whole arena for the first time. A perfect circle. With a perfect wheel in the middle. The sky above the circumference of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink. And I think I can make out one or two of those wavy squares, chinks in the armor, Wiress and Beetee called them, because they reveal what was meant to be hidden and are therefore a weakness. Just to make absolutely sure, I shoot an arrow into the empty space above the tree line. There’s a spurt of light, a flash of real blue sky, and the arrow’s thrown back into the jungle. I climb down to give the others the bad news.
“The force field has us trapped in a circle. A dome, really. I don’t know how high it goes. There’s the Cornucopia, the sea, and then the jungle all around. Very exact. Very symmetrical. And not very large,” I say.
“Did you see any water?” asks Finnick.
“Only the saltwater where we started the Games,” I say.
“There must be some other source,” says Peeta, frowning. “Or we’ll all be dead in a matter of days.”
“Well, the foliage is thick. Maybe there are ponds or springs somewhere,” I say doubtfully. I instinctively feel the Capitol might want these unpopular Games over as soon as possible. Plutarch Heavensbee might have already been given orders to knock us off. “At any rate, there’s no point in trying to find out what’s over the edge of this hill, because the answer is nothing.”
“There must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel,” Peeta insists. We all know what this means. Heading back down. Heading back to the Careers and the bloodshed. With Mags hardly able to walk and Peeta too weak to fight."

Mags and Finnick have created a hut of sorts out of the grass mats, open on one side but with three walls, a floor, and a roof. Mags has also plaited several bowls that Peeta has filled with roasted nuts. Their faces turn to me hopefully, but I give my head a shake. “No. No water. It’s out there, though. He knew where it was,” I say, hoisting the skinned rodent up for all to see. “He’d been drinking recently when I shot him out of a tree, but I couldn’t find his source. I swear, I covered every inch of ground in a thirty-yard radius.”
“Can we eat him?” Peeta asks.
“I don’t know for sure. But his meat doesn’t look that different from a squirrel’s. He ought to be cooked…” I hesitate as I think of trying to start a fire out here from complete scratch. Even if I succeed, there’s the smoke to think about. We’re all so close together in this arena, there’s no chance of hiding it.
Peeta has another idea. He takes a cube of rodent meat, skewers it on the tip of a pointed stick, and lets it fall into the force field. There’s a sharp sizzle and the stick flies back. The chunk of meat is blackened on the outside but well cooked inside. We give him a round of applause, then quickly stop, remembering where we are.
The white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut. I’m still leery about the nuts, but Finnick says Mags recognized them from another Games. I didn’t bother spending time at the edible-plants station in training because it was so effortless for me last year. Now I wish I had. For surely there would have been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me. And I might have guessed a bit more about where I was headed. Mags seems fine, though, and she’s been eating the nuts for hours. So I pick one up and take a small bite. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor that reminds me of a chestnut. I decide it’s all right. The rodent’s strong and gamey but surprisingly juicy. Really, it’s not a bad meal for our first night in the arena. If only we had something to wash it down with.
Finnick asks a lot of questions about the rodent, which we decide to call a tree rat. How high was it, how long did I watch it before I shot, and what was it doing? I don’t remember"

As I listen to the strains of the anthem I think, It will be harder for Finnick and Mags. But it turns out to be plenty hard for me as well. Seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky.
The man from District 5, the one Finnick took out with his trident, is the first to appear. That means that all the tributes in 1 through 4 are alive—the four Careers, Beetee and Wiress, and, of course, Mags and Finnick. The man from District 5 is followed by the male morphling from 6, Cecelia and Woof from 8, both from 9, the woman from 10, and Seeder from 11. The Capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except for the moon.
No one speaks. I can’t pretend I knew any of them well. But I’m thinking of those three kids hanging on to Cecelia when they took her away. Seeder’s kindness to me at our meeting. Even the thought of the glazed-eyed morphling painting my cheeks with yellow flowers gives me a pang. All dead. All gone."

On the parachute sits a small metal object that I can’t place. “What is it?” I ask. No one knows. We pass it from hand to hand, taking turns examining it. It’s a hollow metal tube, tapered slightly at one end. On the other end a small lip curves downward. It’s vaguely familiar. A part that could have fallen off a bicycle, a curtain rod, anything, really.
Peeta blows on one end to see if it makes a sound. It doesn’t. Finnick slides his pinkie into it, testing it out as a weapon. Useless.
“Can you fish with it, Mags?” I ask. Mags, who can fish with almost anything, shakes her head and grunts.
I take it and roll it back and forth on my palm. Since we’re allies, Haymitch will be working with the District 4 mentors. He had a hand in choosing this gift. That means it’s valuable. Lifesaving, even. I think back to last year, when I wanted water so badly, but he wouldn’t send it because he knew I could find it if I tried. Haymitch’s gifts, or lack thereof, carry weighty messages. I can almost hear him growling at me, Use your brain if you have one. What is it?
I wipe the sweat from my eyes and hold the gift out in the moonlight. I move it this way and that, viewing it from different angles, covering portions and then revealing them. Trying to make it divulge its purpose to me. Finally, in frustration, I jam one end into the dirt. “I give up. Maybe if we hook up with Beetee or Wiress they can figure it out.”
I stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing in aggravation. Peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and I let myself relax a little. I wonder why this place hasn’t cooled off at all now that the sun’s gone down. I wonder what’s going on back home.
Prim. My mother. Gale. Madge. I think of them watching me from home. At least I hope they’re at home. Not taken into custody by Thread. Being punished as Cinna is. As Darius is. Punished because of me. Everybody.
I begin to ache for them, for my district, for my woods. A decent woods with sturdy hardwood trees, plentiful food, game that isn’t creepy. Rushing streams. Cool breezes. No, cold winds to blow this stifling heat away. I conjure up such a wind in my mind, letting it freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers, and all at once, the piece of metal half buried in the black earth has a name.
“A spile!” I exclaim, sitting bolt upright.
“What?” asks Finnick.
I wrestle the thing from the ground and brush it clean. Cup my hand around the tapered end, concealing it, and look at the lip. Yes, I’ve seen one of these before. On a cold, windy day long ago, when I was out in the woods with my father. Inserted snugly into a hole drilled in the side of a maple. A pathway for the sap to follow as it flowed into our bucket. Maple syrup could make even our dull bread a treat. After my father died, I didn’t know what happened to the handful of spiles he had. Hidden out in the woods somewhere, probably. Never to be found.
“It’s a spile. Sort of like a faucet. You put it in a tree and sap comes out.” I look at the sinewy green trunks around me. “Well, the right sort of tree.”
“Sap?” asks Finnick. They don’t have the right kind of trees by the sea, either.
“To make syrup,” says Peeta. “But there must be something else inside these trees.”
We’re all on our feet at once. Our thirst. The lack of springs. The tree rat’s sharp front teeth and wet muzzle. There can only be one thing worth having inside these trees. Finnick goes to hammer the spile into the green bark of a massive tree with a rock, but I stop him. “Wait. You might damage it. We need to drill a hole first,” I say.
There’s nothing to drill with, so Mags offers her awl and Peeta drives it straight into the bark, burying the spike two inches deep. He and Finnick take turns opening up the hole with the awl and the knives until it can hold the spile. I wedge it in carefully and we all stand back in anticipation. At first nothing happens. Then a drop of water rolls down the lip and lands in Mags’s palm. She licks it off and holds out her hand for more.
By wiggling and adjusting the spile, we get a thin stream running out. We take turns holding our mouths under the tap, wetting our parched tongues. Mags brings over a basket, and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water. We fill the basket and pass it around, taking deep gulps and, later, luxuriously, splashing our faces clean. Like everything here, the water’s on the warm side, but this is no time to be picky.
Without our thirst to distract us, we’re "

I can tell that however much he denied it during the day, the aftereffects of hitting the force field have been significant. He’s slow, much slower than usual. And the tangle of vines and undergrowth, which unbalance me occasionally, trip him at every step.
I look back at the wall of fog extending in a straight line as far as I can see in either direction. A terrible impulse to flee, to abandon Peeta and save myself, shoots through me. It would be so simple, to run full out, perhaps to even climb a tree above the fog line, which seems to top out at about forty feet. I remember how I did just this when the muttations appeared in the last Games. Took off and only thought of Peeta when I’d reached the Cornucopia. But this time, I trap my terror, push it down, and stay by his side. This time my survival isn’t the goal. Peeta’s is. I think of the eyes glued to the television screens in the districts, seeing if I will run, as the Capitol wishes, or hold my ground.
I lock my fingers tightly into his and say, “Watch my feet. Just try to step where I step.” It helps. We seem to move a little faster, but never enough to afford a rest, and the mist continues to lap at our heels. Droplets spring free of the body of vapor. They burn, but not like fire. Less a sense of heat and more of intense pain as the chemicals find our flesh, cling to it, and burrow down through the layers of skin. Our jumpsuits are no help at all. We may as well be dressed in tissue paper, for all the protection they give."

Although my instinct is to run directly away from it, I realize Finnick is moving at a diagonal down the hill. He’s trying to keep a distance from the gas while steering us toward the water that surrounds the Cornucopia. Yes, water, I think as the acid droplets bore deeper into me. Now I’m so thankful I didn’t kill Finnick, because how would I have gotten Peeta out of here alive? So thankful to have someone else on my side, even if it’s only temporarily.

Almost like a cat’s, with a strange reflective quality. Maybe because they are shiny with tears. “No,” he says. “I can’t carry them both. My arms aren’t working.” It’s true. His arms jerk uncontrollably at his sides. His hands are empty. Of his three tridents, only one remains, and it’s in Peeta’s hands. “I’m sorry, Mags. I can’t do it.”
What happens next is so fast, so senseless, I can’t even move to stop it. Mags hauls herself up, plants a kiss on Finnick’s lips, and then hobbles straight into the fog. Immediately, her body is seized by wild contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible dance.
I want to scream, but my throat is on fire. I take one futile step in her direction when I hear the cannon blast, know her heart has stopped, that she is dead. “Finnick?” I call out hoarsely, but he has already turned from the scene, already continued his retreat from the fog. Dragging my useless leg behind me, I stagger after him, having no idea what else to do.
Time and space lose meaning as the fog seems to invade my brain, muddling my thoughts, making everything unreal. Some deep-rooted animal desire for survival keeps me stumbling after Finnick and Peeta, continuing to move, although I’m probably dead already. Parts of me are dead, or clearly dying. And Mags is dead. This is something I know, or maybe just think I know, because it makes no sense at all."

Little by little, one small portion of a limb at a time, I soak the poison out of my wounds. Peeta seems to be doing the same. But Finnick backed away from the water at first touch and lies facedown on the sand, either unwilling or unable to purge himself.
Finally, when I have survived the worst, opening my eyes underwater, sniffing water into my sinuses and snorting it out, and even gargling repeatedly to wash out my throat, I’m functional enough to help Finnick. Some feeling has returned to my leg, but my arms are still riddled with spasms. I can’t drag Finnick into the water, and possibly the pain would kill him, anyway. So I scoop up shaky handfuls and empty them on his fists. Since he’s not underwater, the poison comes out of his wounds just as it went in, in wisps of fog that I take great care to steer clear of. Peeta recovers enough to help me. He cuts away Finnick’s jumpsuit. Somewhere he finds two shells that work much better than our hands do. We concentrate on soaking Finnick’s arms first, since they have been so badly damaged, and even though a lot of white stuff pours out of them, he doesn’t notice. He just lies there, eyes shut, giving an occasional moan.

“I’m going to try to tap a tree,” I say. My fingers fumble at my belt and find the spile still hanging from its vine.
“Let me make the hole first,” says Peeta. “You stay with him. You’re the healer.”
That’s a joke, I think. But I don’t say it out loud, since Finnick has enough to deal with. He got the worst of the fog, although I’m not sure why. Maybe because he’s the biggest or maybe because he had to exert himself the most. And then, of course, there’s Mags. I still don’t understand what happened there. Why he essentially abandoned her to carry Peeta. Why she not only didn’t question it, but ran straight to her death without a moment’s hesitation. Was it because she was so old that her days were numbered, anyway? Did they think that Finnick would stand a better chance of winning if he had Peeta and me as allies?

I have moved out a bit farther into the shallows, floating alternately on my belly and back. If the seawater healed Peeta and me, it seems to be transforming Finnick altogether. He begins to move slowly, just testing his limbs, and gradually begins to swim. But it’s not like me swimming, the rhythmic strokes, the even pace. It’s like watching some strange sea animal coming back to life. He dives and surfaces, spraying water out of his mouth, rolls over and over in some bizarre corkscrew motion that makes me dizzy even to watch.

Leap impossible distances from tree to tree. Fangs bared, hackles raised, claws shooting out like switchblades. I may be unfamiliar with monkeys, but animals in nature don’t act like this. “Mutts!” I spit out as Finnick and I crash into the greenery.
I know every arrow must count, and they do. In the eerie light, I bring down monkey after monkey, targeting eyes and hearts and throats, so that each hit means a death. But still it wouldn’t be enough without Finnick spearing the beasts like fish and flinging them aside, Peeta slashing away with his knife. I feel claws on my leg, down my back, before someone takes out the attacker. The air grows heavy with trampled plants, the scent of blood, and the musty stink of the monkeys. Peeta and Finnick and I position ourselves in a triangle, a few yards apart, our backs to one another. My heart sinks as my fingers draw back my last arrow. Then I remember Peeta has a sheath, too. And he’s not shooting, he’s hacking away with that knife. My own knife is out now, but the monkeys are quicker, can spring in and out so fast you can barely react.
“Peeta!” I shout. “Your arrows!”
Peeta turns to see my predicament and is sliding off his sheath when it happens. A monkey lunges out of a tree for his chest. I have no arrow, no way to shoot. I can hear the thud of Finnick’s trident finding another mark and know his weapon is occupied. Peeta’s knife arm is disabled as he tries to remove the sheath. I throw my knife at the oncoming mutt but the creature somersaults, evading the blade, and stays on its trajectory.
Weaponless, defenseless, I do the only thing I can think of. I run for Peeta, to knock him to the ground, to protect his body with mine, even though I know I won’t make it in time.
She does, though. Materializing, it seems, from thin air. One moment nowhere, the next reeling in front of Peeta. Already bloody, mouth open in a high-pitched scream, pupils enlarged so her eyes seem like black holes.

Sagging skin, sickly green, her ribs as prominent as a child’s dead of starvation. Surely she could afford food, but turned to the morphling just as Haymitch turned to drink, I guess. Everything about her speaks of waste—her body, her life, the vacant look in her eyes. I hold one of her twitching hands, unclear whether it moves from the poison that affected our nerves, the shock of the attack, or withdrawal from the drug that was her sustenance. There is nothing we can do. Nothing but stay with her while she dies.
“I’ll watch the trees,” Finnick says before walking away. I’d like to walk away, too, but she grips my hand so tightly I would have to pry off her fingers, and I don’t have the strength for that kind of cruelty. I think of Rue, how maybe I could sing a song or something. But I don’t even know the morphling’s name, let alone if she likes songs. I just know she’s dying.
Peeta crouches down on the other side of her and strokes her hair. When he begins to speak in a soft voice, it seems almost nonsensical, but the words aren’t for me. “With my paint box at home, I can make every color imaginable. Pink. As pale as a baby’s skin. Or as deep as rhubarb. Green like spring grass. Blue that shimmers like ice on water.”
The morphling stares into Peeta’s eyes, hanging on to his words.
“One time, I spent three days mixing paint until I found the right shade for sunlight on white fur. You see, I kept thinking it was yellow, but it was much more than that. Layers of all sorts of color. One by one,” says Peeta.
The morphling’s breathing is slowing into shallow catch-breaths. Her free hand dabbles in the blood on her chest, making the tiny swirling motions she so loved to paint with.
“I haven’t figured out a rainbow yet. They come so quickly and leave so soon. I never have enough time to capture them. Just a bit of blue here or purple there. And then they fade away again. Back into the air,” says Peeta.
The morphling seems mesmerized by Peeta’s words. Entranced. She lifts up a trembling hand and paints what I think might be a flower on Peeta’s cheek.
“Thank you,” he whispers. “That looks beautiful.”
For a moment, the morphling’s face lights up in a grin and she makes a small squeaking sound. Then her blooddappled hand falls back onto her chest, she gives one last huff of air, and the cannon fires. The grip on my hand releases.
Peeta carries her out into the water. He returns and sits beside me. The morphling floats out toward the Cornucopia for a while, then the hovercraft appears and a four-pronged claw drops, encases her, carries her into the night sky, and she’s gone.
Finnick rejoins us, his fist full of my arrows still wet with monkey blood. He drops them beside me on the sand. “Thought you might want these.”

“No, Katniss, I’d rather,” says Finnick. I look in his eyes, at his face, and realize he’s barely holding back tears. Mags. The least I can do is give him the privacy to mourn her.
“All right, Finnick, thanks,” I say. I lie down on the sand with Peeta, who drifts off at once. I stare into the night, thinking of what a difference a day makes. How yesterday morning, Finnick was on my kill list, and now I’m willing to sleep with him as my guard. He saved Peeta and let Mags die and I don’t know why. Only that I can never settle the balance owed between us. All I can do at the moment is go to sleep and let him grieve in peace. And so I do.
It’s midmorning when I open my eyes again. Peeta’s still out beside me. Above us, a mat of grass suspended on branches shields our faces from the sunlight. I sit up and see that Finnick’s hands have not been idle. Two woven bowls are filled with fresh water. A third holds a mess of shellfish.
Finnick sits on the sand, cracking them open with a stone. “They’re better fresh,” he says, ripping a chunk of flesh from a shell and popping it into his mouth. His eyes are still puffy but I pretend not to notice.
My stomach begins to growl at the smell of food and I reach for one. The sight of my fingernails, caked with blood, stops me. I’ve been scratching my skin raw in my sleep."

“That’s what I’ve heard,” I say. I go into the saltwater and wash off the blood, trying to decide which I hate more, pain or itching. Fed up, I stomp back onto the beach, turn my face upward, and snap, “Hey, Haymitch, if you’re not too drunk, we could use a little something for our skin.”
It’s almost funny how quickly the parachute appears above me. I reach up and the tube lands squarely in my open hand. “About time,” I say, but I can’t keep the scowl on my face. Haymitch. What I wouldn’t give for five minutes of conversation with him.
I plunk down on the sand next to Finnick and screw the lid off the tube. Inside is a thick, dark ointment with a pungent smell, a combination of tar and pine needles. I wrinkle my nose as I squeeze a glob of the medicine onto my palm and begin to massage it into my leg. A sound of pleasure slips out of my mouth as the stuff eradicates my itching. It also stains my scabby skin a ghastly gray-green. As I start on the second leg I toss the tube to Finnick, who eyes me doubtfully.
“It’s like you’re decomposing,” says Finnick. But I guess the itching wins out, because after a minute Finnick begins to treat his own skin, too. Really, the combination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous. I can’t help enjoying his distress.
“Poor Finnick. Is this the first time in your life you haven’t looked pretty?” I say.
“It must be. The sensation’s completely new. How have you managed it all these years?” he asks.
“Just avoid mirrors. You’ll forget about it,” I say.
“Not if I keep looking at you,” he says.
We slather ourselves down, even taking turns rubbing the ointment into each other’s backs where the undershirts don’t protect our skin. “I’m going to wake Peeta,” I say.
“No, wait,” says Finnick. “Let’s do it together. Put our faces right in front of his.”
Well, there’s so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. We position ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inches from his nose, and give him a shake. “Peeta. Peeta, wake up,” I say in a soft, singsong voice.
His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we’ve stabbed him. “Aa!”
Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we try to stop, we look at Peeta’s attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again. By the time we pull ourselves together, I’m thinking that maybe Finnick Odair is all right. At least not as vain or self-important as I’d thought. Not so bad at all, really. And just as I’ve come to this conclusion, a parachute lands next to us with a fresh loaf of bread. Remembering from last year how Haymitch’s gifts are often timed to send a message, I make a note to myself. Be friends with Finnick. You’ll get food.
Finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining the crust. A bit too possessively. It’s not necessary. It’s got that green tint from seaweed that the bread from District 4 always has. We all know it’s his. Maybe he’s just realized how precious it is, and that he may never see another loaf again. Maybe some memory of Mags is associated with the crust. But all he says is, “This will go well with the shellfish.”
While I help Peeta coat his skin with the ointment, Finnick deftly cleans the meat from the shellfish. We gather round and eat the delicious sweet flesh with the salty bread from District 4.

The trio’s in bad shape—you can see that right off. One is being practically dragged out by a second, and the third wanders in loopy circles, as if deranged. They’re a solid brick-red color, as if they’ve been dipped in paint and left out to dry.
“Who is that?” asks Peeta. “Or what? Muttations?”
I draw back an arrow, readying for an attack. But all that happens is that the one who was being dragged collapses on the beach. The dragger stamps the ground in frustration and, in an apparent fit of temper, turns and shoves the circling, deranged one over.
Finnick’s face lights up. “Johanna!” he calls, and runs for the red things.
“Finnick!” I hear Johanna’s voice reply.
I exchange a look with Peeta. “What now?” I ask.
“We can’t really leave Finnick,” he says.
“Guess not. Come on, then,” I say grouchily, because even if I’d had a list of allies, Johanna Mason would definitely not have been on it. The two of us tromp down the beach to where Finnick and Johanna are just meeting up. As we move in closer, I see her companions, and confusion sets in. That’s Beetee on the ground on his back and Wiress who’s regained her feet to continue making loops. “She’s got Wiress and Beetee.”
“Nuts and Volts?” says Peeta, equally puzzled. “I’ve got to hear how this happened.”
When we reach them, Johanna’s gesturing toward the jungle and talking very fast to Finnick. “We thought it was rain, you know, because of the lightning, and we were all so thirsty. But when it started coming down, it turned out to be blood. Thick, hot blood. You couldn’t see, you couldn’t speak without getting a mouthful. We just staggered around, trying to get out of it. That’s when Blight hit the force field.”
“I’m sorry, Johanna,” says Finnick. It takes a moment to place Blight. I think he was Johanna’s male counterpart from District 7, but I hardly remember seeing him. Come to think of it, I don’t even think he showed up for training.
“Yeah, well, he wasn’t much, but he was from home,” she says. “And he left me alone with these two.” She nudges Beetee, who’s barely conscious, with her shoe. “He got a knife in the back at the Cornucopia. And her"

Johanna narrows her brown eyes at me in hatred. “Lay off her?” she hisses. She steps forward before I can react and slaps me so hard I see stars. “Who do you think got them out of that bleeding jungle for you? You—” Finnick tosses her writhing body over his shoulder and carries her out into the water and repeatedly dunks her while she screams a lot of really insulting things at me. But I don’t shoot. Because she’s with Finnick and because of what she said, about getting them for me.
“What did she mean? She got them for me?” I ask Peeta.
“I don’t know. You did want them originally,” he reminds me.
“Yeah, I did. Originally.” But that answers nothing. I look down at Beetee’s inert body. “But I won’t have them long unless we do something.”

Our kitchen table’s been full of so many naked men this year. You kind of get used to it after a while.
We put down Finnick’s mat and lay Beetee on his stomach so we can examine his back. There’s a gash about six inches long running from his shoulder blade to below his ribs. Fortunately it’s not too deep. He’s lost a lot of blood, though—you can tell by the pallor of his skin—and it’s still oozing out of the wound.
I sit back on my heels, trying to think. What do I have to work with? Seawater? I feel like my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything was snow. I look over at the jungle. I bet there’s a whole pharmacy in there if I knew how to use it. But these aren’t my plants. Then I think about the moss Mags gave me to blow my nose. “Be right back,” I tell Peeta. Fortunately the stuff seems to be pretty common in the jungle. I rip an armful from the nearby trees and carry it back to the beach. I make a thick pad out of the moss, place it on Beetee’s cut, and secure it by tying vines around his body. We get some water into him and then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle.
“I think that’s all we can do,” I say.
“It’s good. You’re good with this healing stuff,” he says. “It’s in your blood.”
“No,” I say, shaking my head. “I got my father’s blood.” The kind that quickens during a hunt, not an epidemic. “I’m going to see about Wiress.”

“In the fog. Finnick had Peeta. I had Mags for a while. Then I couldn’t lift her. Finnick said he couldn’t take them both. She kissed him and walked right into the poison,” I say.
“She was Finnick’s mentor, you know,” Johanna says accusingly.
“No, I didn’t,” I say.
“She was half his family,” she says a few moments later, but there’s less venom behind it.
We watch the water lap up over the undergarments. “So what were you doing with Nuts and Volts?” I ask.
“I told you—I got them for you. Haymitch said if we were to be allies I had to bring them to you,” says Johanna. “That’s what you told him, right?”
No, I think. But I nod my head in assent. “Thanks. I appreciate it.”
“I hope so.” She gives me a look filled with loathing, like I’m the biggest drag possible on her life. I wonder if this is what it’s like to have an older sister who really hates you.

Across the water, off to the right, I see the enormous flash as the lightning bolt hits the tree and the electrical storm begins again. Right in the same area it did last night. Someone must have moved into its range, triggered the attack. I sit for a while watching the lightning, keeping Wiress calm, lulled into a sort of peacefulness by the lapping of the water. I think of last night, how the lightning began just after the bell tolled. Twelve bongs.
“Tick, tock,” Wiress says, surfacing to consciousness for a moment and then going back under.
Twelve bongs last night. Like it was midnight. Then lightning. The sun overhead now. Like it’s noon. And lightning.
Slowly I rise up and survey the arena. The lightning there. In the next pie wedge over came the blood rain, where Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee were caught. We would have been in the third section, right next to that, when the fog appeared. And as soon as it was sucked away, the monkeys began to gather in the fourth. Tick, tock. My head snaps to the other side. A couple of hours ago, at around ten, that wave came out of the second section to the left of where the lightning strikes now. At noon. At midnight. At noon.
“Tick, tock,” Wiress says in her sleep. As the lightning ceases and the blood rain begins just to the right of it, her words suddenly make sense.
“Oh,” I say under my breath. “Tick, tock.” My eyes sweep around the full circle of the arena and I know she’s right. “Tick, tock. This is a clock.”"

While the others collect our few possessions and get Beetee back into his jumpsuit, I rouse Wiress. She awakes with a panicked “tick, tock!”
“Yes, tick, tock, the arena’s a clock. It’s a clock, Wiress, you were right,” I say. “You were right.”
Relief floods her face—I guess because somebody has finally understood what she’s known probably from the first tolling of the bells. “Midnight.”
“It starts at midnight,” I confirm.
A memory struggles to surface in my brain. I see a clock. No, it’s a watch, resting in Plutarch Heavensbee’s palm. “It starts at midnight,” Plutarch said. And then my mockingjay lit up briefly and vanished. In retrospect, it’s like he was giving me a clue about the arena. But why would he? At the time, I was no more a tribute in these Games than he was. Maybe he thought it would help me as a mentor. Or maybe this had been the plan all along."

Wiress nods and scampers over to the water’s edge, where she dunks the coil in the water. She starts quietly singing some funny little song, about a mouse running up a clock. It must be for children, but it seems to make her happy.
“Oh, not the song again,” says Johanna, rolling her eyes. “That went on for hours before she started tick-tocking.”
Suddenly Wiress stands up very straight and points to the jungle. “Two,” she says.
I follow her finger to where the wall of fog has just begun to seep out onto the beach. “Yes, look, Wiress is right. It’s two o’clock and the fog has started.”
“Like clockwork,” says Peeta. “You were very smart to figure that out, Wiress.”
Wiress smiles and goes back to singing and dunking her coil. “Oh, she’s more than smart,” says Beetee. “She’s intuitive.” We all turn to look at Beetee, who seems to be coming back to life. “She can sense things before anyone else. Like a canary in one of your coal mines.”
“What’s that?” Finnick asks me.
“It’s a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if there’s bad air,” I say.
“What’s it do, die?” asks Johanna.
“It stops singing first. That’s when you should get out. But if the air’s too bad, it dies, yes. And so do you.” I don’t want to talk about dying songbirds. They bring up thoughts of my father’s death and Rue’s death and Maysilee Donner’s death and my mother inheriting her songbird. Oh, great, and now I’m thinking of Gale, deep down in that horrible mine, with President Snow’s threat hanging over his head. So easy to make it look like an accident down there. A silent canary, a spark, and nothing more.
I go back to imagining killing the president."

It seems an odd choice until I see her throw one with such force it sticks in the sunsoftened gold of the Cornucopia. Of course. Johanna Mason. District 7. Lumber. I bet she’s been tossing around axes since she could toddle. It’s like Finnick with his trident. Or Beetee with his wire. Rue with her knowledge of plants. I realize it’s just another disadvantage the District 12 tributes have faced over the years. We don’t go down in the mines until we’re eighteen. It looks like most of the other tributes learn something about their trades early on. There are things you do in a mine that could come in handy in the Games. Wielding a pick. Blowing things up.

I spring forward in pursuit. Boom! Boom! Boom! The cannon confirms there’s no way to help Wiress, no need to finish off Gloss or Cashmere.

Finnick reviving Peeta after the force field stopped his heart. Mags running into the fog so that Finnick could carry Peeta. The morphling hurling herself in front of him to block the monkey’s attack.

So why have they chosen Peeta to protect? What has Haymitch possibly said to them, what has he bargained with to make them put Peeta’s life above their own?
I know my own reasons for keeping Peeta alive. He’s my friend, and this is my way to defy the Capitol, to subvert its terrible Games. But if I had no real ties to him, what would make me want to save him, to choose him over myself? Certainly he is brave, but we have all been brave enough to survive a Games. There is that quality of goodness that’s hard to overlook, but still…and then I think of it, what Peeta can do so much better than the rest of us. He can use words. He obliterated the rest of the field at both interviews. And maybe it’s because of that underlying goodness that he can move a crowd—no, a country—to his side with the turn of a simple sentence.
I remember thinking that was the gift the leader of our revolution should have. Has Haymitch convinced the others of this? That Peeta’s tongue would have far greater power against the Capitol than any physical strength the rest of us could claim? I don’t know. It still seems like a really long leap for some of the tributes. I mean, we’re talking about Johanna Mason here. But what other explanation can there be for their decided efforts to keep him alive?

Vines cut into my face and arms, creepers grab my feet. But I am getting closer to her. Closer. Very close now. Sweat pours down my face, stinging the healing acid wounds. I pant, trying to get some use out of the warm, moist air that seems empty of oxygen. Prim makes a sound—such a lost, irretrievable sound—that I can’t even imagine what they have done to evoke it.
“Prim!” I rip through a wall of green into a small clearing and the sound repeats directly above me. Above me? My head whips back. Do they have her up in the trees? I desperately search the branches but see nothing. “Prim?” I say pleadingly. I hear her but can’t see her. Her next wail rings out, clear as a bell, and there’s no mistaking the source. It’s coming from the mouth of a small, crested black bird perched on a branch about ten feet over my head. And then I understand.
It’s a jabberjay.
I’ve never seen one before—I thought they no longer existed—and for a moment, as I lean against the trunk of the tree, clutching the stitch in my side, I examine it. The muttation, the forerunner, the father. I pull up a mental image of a mockingbird, fuse it with the jabberjay, and yes, I can see how they mated to make my mockingjay. There is nothing about the bird that suggests it’s a mutt. Nothing except the horribly lifelike sounds of Prim’s voice streaming from its mouth. I silence it with an arrow in its throat. The bird falls to the ground. I remove my arrow and wring its neck for good measure. Then I hurl the revolting thing into the jungle. No degree of hunger would ever tempt me to eat it.
It wasn’t real, I tell myself. The same way the muttation wolves last year weren’t really the dead tributes. It’s just a sadistic trick of the Gamemakers.
Finnick crashes into the clearing to find me wiping my arrow clean with some moss. “Katniss?”
“It’s okay. I’m okay,” I say, although I don’t feel okay at all. “I thought I heard my sister but—” The piercing shriek cuts me off. It’s another voice, not Prim’s, maybe a young woman’s. I don’t recognize it. But the effect on Finnick is instantaneous. The color vanishes from his face and I can actually see his pupils dilate in fear. “Finnick, wait!” I say, reaching out to reassure him, but he’s bolted away. Gone off in pursuit of the victim, as mindlessly as I pursued Prim. “Finnick!” I call, but I know he won’t turn back and wait for me to give a rational explanation. So all I can do is follow him.
It’s no effort to track him, even though he’s moving so fast, since he leaves a clear, trampled path in his wake. But the bird is at least a quarter mile away, most of it uphill, and by the time I reach him, I’m winded. He’s circling around a giant tree. The trunk must be four feet in diameter and the limbs don’t even begin until twenty feet up. The woman’s shrieks emanate from somewhere in the foliage, but the jabberjay’s concealed. Finnick’s screaming as well, over and over. “Annie! Annie!” He’s in a state of panic and completely unreachable, so I do what I would do anyway. I scale an adjacent tree, locate the jabberjay, and take it out with an arrow. It falls straight down, landing right at Finnick’s feet. He picks it up, slowly making the connection, but when I slide down to join him, he looks more despairing than ever.
“It’s all right, Finnick. It’s just a jabberjay. They’re playing a trick on us,” I say. “It’s not real. It’s not your…Annie.”
“No, it’s not Annie. But the voice was hers. Jabberjays mimic what they hear. Where did they get those screams, Katniss?” he says.
I can feel my own cheeks grow pale as I understand his meaning. “Oh, Finnick, you don’t think they…”
“Yes. I do. That’s exactly what I think,” he says.
I have an image of Prim in a white room, strapped to a table, while masked, robed figures elicit those sounds from her. Somewhere they are torturing her, or did torture her, to get those sounds. My knees turn to water and I sink to the ground. Finnick is trying to tell me something, but I can’t hear him. What I do finally hear is another bird starting up somewhere off to my left. And this time, the voice is Gale’s.
Finnick catches my arm before I can run. “No. It’s not him.” He starts pulling me downhill, toward the beach. “We’re getting out of here!” But Gale’s voice is so full of pain I can’t help struggling to reach it. “It’s not him, Katniss! It’s a mutt!” Finnick shouts at me. “Come on!” He moves me along, half dragging, half carrying me, until I can process what he said. He’s right, it’s just another jabberjay.

“I heard Prim. Right in the beginning. But it wasn’t her,” he says. “It was a jabberjay.”
“It was her. Somewhere. The jabberjay just recorded it,” I say.
“No, that’s what they want you to think. The same way I wondered if Glimmer’s eyes were in that mutt last year. But those weren’t Glimmer’s eyes. And that wasn’t Prim’s voice.

I know he’s trying to help me, so I make myself think. “At the final eight?” I repeat. “They interview your family and friends back home.”
“That’s right,” says Peeta. “They interview your family and friends. And can they do that if they’ve killed them all?”
“No?” I ask, still unsure.
“No. That’s how we know Prim’s alive. She’ll be the first one they interview, won’t she?” he asks.

“First Prim. Then your mother. Your cousin, Gale. Madge,” he continues. “It was a trick, Katniss. A horrible one. But we’re the only ones who can be hurt by it. We’re the ones in the Games. Not them.”
“You really believe that?” I say.
“I really do,” says Peeta. I waver, thinking of how Peeta can make anyone believe anything. I look over at Finnick for confirmation, see he’s fixated on Peeta, his words.
“Do you believe it, Finnick?” I ask.
“It could be true. I don’t know,” he says. “Could they do that, Beetee? Take someone’s regular voice and make it…”
“Oh, yes. It’s not even that difficult, Finnick. Our children learn a similar technique in school,” says Beetee.
“Of course Peeta’s right. The whole country adores Katniss’s little sister. If they really killed her like this, they’d probably have an uprising on their hands,” says Johanna flatly. “Don’t want that, do they?” She throws back her head and shouts, “Whole country in rebellion? Wouldn’t want anything like that!”
My mouth drops open in shock. No one, ever, says anything like this in the Games. Absolutely, they’ve cut away from Johanna, are editing her out. But I have heard her and can never think about her again in the same way. She’ll never win any awards for kindness, but she certainly is gutsy. Or crazy. She picks up some shells and heads toward the jungle. “I’m getting water,” she says.
I can’t help catching her hand as she passes me. “Don’t go in there. The birds—” I remember the birds must be gone, but I still don’t want anyone in there. Not even her.
“They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no one left I love,” Johanna says, and frees her hand with an impatient shake. When she brings me back a shell of water, I take it with a silent nod of thanks, knowing how much she would despise the pity in my voice.
While Johanna collects water and my arrows, Beetee fiddles with his wire, and Finnick takes to the water. I need to clean up, too, but I stay in Peeta’s arms, still too shaken to move."

“Somebody named Annie,” I say.
“Must be Annie Cresta,” he says.
“Who?” I ask.
“Annie Cresta. She was the girl Mags volunteered for. She won about five years ago,” says Peeta.
That would have been the summer after my father died, when I first began feeding my family, when my whole being was occupied with battling starvation. “I don’t remember those Games much,” I say. “Was that the earthquake year?”
“Yeah. Annie’s the one who went mad when her district partner got beheaded. Ran off by herself and hid. But an earthquake broke a dam and most of the arena got flooded. She won because she was the best swimmer,” says Peeta.
“Did she get better after?” I ask. “I mean, her mind?”
“I don’t know. I don’t remember ever seeing her at the Games again. But she didn’t look too stable during the reaping this year,” says Peeta.
So that’s who Finnick loves, I think. Not his string of fancy lovers in the Capitol. But a poor, mad girl back home.

At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle, but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. We decide, since this might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. Under Finnick’s guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish, even dive for oysters. I like this last part best, not because I have any great appetite for oysters. I only ever tasted them once, in the Capitol, and I couldn’t get around the sliminess.

Peeta’s just pried open an oyster when I hear him give a laugh. “Hey, look at this!” He holds up a glistening, perfect pearl about the size of a pea. “You know, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls,” he says earnestly to Finnick.
“No, it doesn’t,” says Finnick dismissively. But I crack up, remembering that’s how a clueless Effie Trinket presented us to the people of the Capitol last year, before anyone knew us. As coal pressured into pearls by our weighty existence. Beauty that arose out of pain.
Peeta rinses the pearl off in the water and hands it to me. “For you.” I hold it out on my palm and examine its iridescent surface in the sunlight. Yes, I will keep it. For the few remaining hours of my life I will keep it close. This last gift from Peeta. The only one I can really accept. Perhaps it will give me strength in the final moments.

There was a plan to break us out of the arena from the moment the Quell was announced. The victor tributes from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 had varying degrees of knowledge about it. Plutarch Heavensbee has been, for several years, part of an undercover group aiming to overthrow the Capitol. He made sure the wire was among the weapons. Beetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field. The bread we received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue. The district where the bread originated indicated the day. Three. The number of rolls the hour. Twenty-four. The hovercraft belongs to District 13. Bonnie and Twill, the women I met in the woods from 8, were right about its existence and its defense capabilities. We are currently on a very roundabout journey to District 13. Meanwhile, most of the districts in Panem are in full-scale rebellion."

As soon as the Quarter Quell was over—as soon as I had been lifted from the arena—the electricity in District 12 was cut, the televisions went black, and the Seam became so silent, people could hear one another’s heartbeats. No one did anything to protest or celebrate what had happened in the arena. Yet within fifteen minutes, the sky was filled with hoverplanes and the bombs were raining down.
It was Gale who thought of the Meadow, one of the few places not filled with old wooden homes embedded with coal dust. He herded those he could in its direction, including my mother and Prim. He formed the team that pulled down the fence—now just a harmless chain-link barrier, with the electricity off—and led the people into the woods. He took them to the only place he could think of, the lake my father had shown me as a child. And it was from there they watched the distant flames eat up everything they knew in the world.
By dawn the bombers were long gone, the fires dying, the final stragglers rounded up. My mother and Prim had set up a medical area for the injured and were attempting to treat them with whatever they could glean from the woods. Gale had two sets of bows and arrows, one hunting knife, one fishing net, and over eight hundred terrified people to feed. With the help of those who were able-bodied, they managed for three days. And that’s when the hovercraft unexpectedly arrived to evacuate them to District 13, where there were more than enough clean, white living compartments, plenty of clothing, and three meals a day. The compartments had the disadvantage of being underground, the clothing was identical, and the food was relatively tasteless, but for the refugees of 12, these were minor considerations. They were safe. They were being cared for. They were alive and eagerly welcomed."

That’s how they see us.” Back in 10, he’d worked on one of the beef ranches, maintaining the genetic diversity of the herd with the implantation of long-frozen cow embryos. He’s very likely right about 13, because there don’t seem to be nearly enough kids around. But so what? We’re not being kept in pens, we’re being trained for work, the children are being educated.

The person who the districts—most of which are now openly at war with the Capitol—can count on to blaze the path to victory. I won’t have to do it alone.

They want to transform Finnick into a rebel leader as well, but first they’ll have to get him to stay awake for more than five minutes. Even when he is conscious, you have to say everything to him three times to get through to his brain. The doctors say it’s from the electrical shock he received in the arena, but I know it’s a lot more complicated than that. I know that Finnick can’t focus on anything in 13 because he’s trying so hard to see what’s happening in the Capitol to Annie, the mad girl from his district who’s the only person on earth he loves.

I sit at the table assigned to the Everdeens and the Hawthornes and some other refugees, and shovel my food down, wishing for seconds, but there are never seconds here. They have nutrition down to a science. You leave with enough calories to take you to the next meal, no more, no less. Serving size is based on your age, height, body type, health, and amount of physical labor required by your schedule. The people from 12 are already getting slightly larger portions than the natives of 13 in an effort to bring us up to weight. I guess bony soldiers tire too quickly. It’s working, though. In just a month, we’re starting to look healthier, particularly the kids.
Gale sets his tray beside me and I try not to stare at his turnips too pathetically, because I really want more, and he’s already too quick to slip me his food. Even though I turn my attention to neatly folding my napkin, a spoonful of turnips slops into my bowl.

“You’ve got to stop that,” I say. But since I’m already scooping up the stuff, it’s not too convincing. “Really. It’s probably illegal or something.” They have very strict rules about food. For instance, if you don’t finish something and want to save it for later, you can’t take it from the dining hall. Apparently, in the early days, there was some incident of food hoarding. For a couple of people like Gale and me, who’ve been in charge of our families’ food supply for years, it doesn’t sit well. We know how to be hungry, but not how to be told how to handle what provisions we have. In some ways, District 13 is even more controlling than the Capitol.
“What can they do? They’ve already got my communicuff,” says Gale"

Dead silence. I feel Gale’s body tense. I guess I should have told him before, but I wasn’t sure how he’d respond. Not when it involved Peeta.
“No form of punishment will be inflicted,” I continue. A new thought occurs to me. “The same goes for the other captured tributes, Johanna and Enobaria.” Frankly, I don’t care about Enobaria, the vicious District 2 tribute. In fact, I dislike her, but it seems wrong to leave her out.
“No,” says Coin flatly.
“Yes,” I shoot back. “It’s not their fault you abandoned them in the arena. Who knows what the Capitol’s doing to them?”

“They’ll be tried with other war criminals and treated as the tribunal sees fit,” she says.
“They’ll be granted immunity!” I feel myself rising from my chair, my voice full and resonant. “You will personally pledge this in front of the entire population of District Thirteen and the remainder of Twelve. Soon. Today. It will be recorded for future generations. You will hold yourself and your government responsible for their safety, or you’ll find yourself another Mockingjay!”
My words hang in the air for a long moment.
“That’s her!” I hear Fulvia hiss to Plutarch. “Right there. With the costume, gunfire in the background, just a hint of smoke.”
“Yes, that’s what we want,” says Plutarch under his breath.

I’m aware you have mixed feelings about participating. I hope this will help.”

Plutarch slides the sketchbook across to me. For a moment, I look at it suspiciously. Then curiosity gets the better of me. I open the cover to find a picture of myself, standing straight and strong, in a black uniform. Only one person could have designed the outfit, at first glance utterly utilitarian, at second a work of art. The swoop of the helmet, the curve to the breastplate, the slight fullness of the sleeves that allows the white folds under the arms to show. In his hands, I am again a mockingjay.
“Cinna,” I whisper.
“Yes. He made me promise not to show you this book until you’d decided to be the Mockingjay on your own. Believe me, I was very tempted,” says Plutarch. “Go on. Flip through.”
I turn the pages slowly, seeing each detail of the uniform. The carefully tailored layers of body armor, the hidden weapons in the boots and belt, the special reinforcements over my heart. On the final page, under a sketch of my mockingjay pin, Cinna’s written, I’m still betting on you."

The three figures are only just recognizable by their most striking fashion choices: Venia’s gold facial tattoos. Flavius’s orange corkscrew curls. Octavia’s light evergreen skin, which now hangs too loosely, as if her body were a slowly deflating balloon.
On seeing me, Flavius and Octavia shrink back against the tiled walls like they’re anticipating an attack, even though I have never hurt them. Unkind thoughts were my worst offense against them, and those I kept to myself, so why do they recoil?
The guard’s ordering me out, but by the shuffling that follows, I know Gale has somehow detained him. For answers, I cross to Venia, who was always the strongest. I crouch down and take her icy hands, which clutch mine like vises.
“What happened, Venia?” I ask. “What are you doing here?”
“They took us. From the Capitol,” she says hoarsely.
Plutarch enters behind me. “What on earth is going on?”
“Who took you?” I press her.
“People,” she says vaguely. “The night you broke out.”

“We thought it might be comforting for you to have your regular team,” Plutarch says behind me. “Cinna requested it.”
“Cinna requested this?” I snarl at him. Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that Cinna would never have approved the abuse of these three, who he managed with gentleness and patience. “Why are they being treated like criminals?”
“I honestly don’t know.” There’s something in his voice that makes me believe him, and the pallor on Fulvia’s face confirms it. Plutarch turns to the guard, who’s just appeared in the doorway with Gale right behind him. “I was only told they were being confined. Why are they being punished?”
“For stealing food. We had to restrain them after an altercation over some bread,” says the guard.
Venia’s brows come together as if she’s still trying to make sense of it. “No one would tell us anything. We were so hungry. It was just one slice she took.”
Octavia begins to sob, muffling the sound in her ragged tunic. I think of how, the first time I survived the arena, Octavia sneaked me a roll under the table because she couldn’t bear my hunger. I crawl across to her shaking form. “Octavia?” I touch her and she flinches. “Octavia? It’s going to be all right. I’ll get you out of here, okay?”
“This seems extreme,” says Plutarch.
“It’s because they took a slice of bread?” asks Gale.
“There were repeated infractions leading up to that. They were warned. Still they took more bread.” The guard pauses a moment, as if puzzled by our density. “You can’t take bread.”

I can’t get Octavia to uncover her face, but she lifts it slightly. The shackles on her wrists shift down a few inches, revealing raw sores beneath them. “I’m bringing you to my mother.” I address the guard. “Unchain them.”
The guard shakes his head. “It’s not authorized.”
“Unchain them! Now!” I yell.
This breaks his composure. Average citizens don’t address him this way. “I have no release orders. And you have no authority to—”
“Do it on my authority,” says Plutarch. “We came to collect these three anyway. They’re needed for Special Defense. I’ll take full responsibility.”
The guard leaves to make a call. He returns with a set of keys. The preps have been forced into cramped body positions for so long that even once the shackles are removed, they have trouble walking. Gale"

“They don’t know what, Katniss?” he says. “That tributes—who are the actual children involved here, not your trio of freaks—are forced to fight to the death? That you were going into that arena for people’s amusement? Was that a big secret in the Capitol?”
“No. But they don’t view it the way we do,” I say. “They’re raised on it and—”
“Are you actually defending them?” He slips the skin from the rabbit in one quick move.
That stings, because, in fact, I am, and it’s ridiculous. I struggle to find a logical position. “I guess I’m defending anyone who’s treated like that for taking a slice of bread. Maybe it reminds me too much of what happened to you over a turkey!”
Still, he’s right. It does seem strange, my level of concern over the prep team. I should hate them and want to see them strung up. But they’re so clueless, and they belonged to Cinna, and he was on my side, right?
“I’m not looking for a fight,” Gale says. “But I don’t think Coin was sending you some big message by punishing them for breaking the rules here. She probably thought you’d see it as a favor.” He stuffs the rabbit in the sack and rises. “We better get going if we want to make it back on time.”
I ignore his offer of a hand up and get to my feet unsteadily. “Fine.” Neither of us talks on the way back, but once we’re inside the gate, I think of something else. “During the Quarter Quell, Octavia and Flavius had to quit because they couldn’t stop crying over me going back in. And Venia could barely say good-bye.”
“I’ll try and keep that in mind as they…remake you,” says Gale.
“Do,” I say.
We hand the meat over to Greasy Sae in the kitchen. She likes District 13 well enough, even though she thinks the cooks are somewhat lacking in imagination. But a woman who came up with a palatable wild dog and rhubarb stew is bound to feel as if her hands are tied here.

“Remake her to Beauty Base Zero,” Fulvia ordered first thing this morning. “We’ll work from there.” Beauty Base Zero turns out to be what a person would look like if they stepped out of bed looking flawless but natural. It means my nails are perfectly shaped but not polished. My hair soft and shiny but not styled. My skin smooth and clear but not painted. Wax the body hair and erase the dark circles, but don’t make any noticeable enhancements. I suppose Cinna gave the same instructions the first day I arrived as a tribute in the Capitol. Only that was different, since I was a contestant. As a rebel, I thought I’d get to look more like myself. But it seems a televised rebel has her own standards to live up to.
After I rinse the lather from my body, I turn to find Octavia waiting with a towel. She is so altered from the woman I knew in the Capitol, stripped of the gaudy clothing, the heavy makeup, the dyes and jewelry and knickknacks she adorned her hair with. I remember how one day she showed up with bright pink tresses studded with blinking colored lights shaped like mice. She told me she had several mice at home as pets. The thought repulsed me at the time, since we consider mice vermin, unless cooked. But perhaps Octavia liked them because they were small, soft, and squeaky. Like her. As she pats me dry, I try to become acquainted with the District 13 Octavia. Her real hair turns out to be a nice auburn. Her face is ordinary but has an undeniable sweetness. She’s younger than I thought. Maybe early twenties. Devoid of the three-inch decorative nails, her fingers appear almost stubby, and they can’t stop trembling. I want to tell her it’s okay, that I’ll see that Coin never hurts her again. But the multicolored bruises flowering under her green skin only remind me how impotent I am.
Flavius, too, appears washed out without his purple lipstick and bright clothes. He’s managed to get his orange ringlets back in some sort of order, though. It’s Venia who’s the least changed. Her aqua hair lies flat instead of in spikes and you can see the roots growing in gray. However, the tattoos were always her most striking characteristic, and they’re as golden and shocking as ever. She comes and takes the towel from Octavia’s hands.
“Katniss is not going to hurt us,” she says quietly but firmly to Octavia. “Katniss did not even know we were here. Things will be better now.” Octavia gives a slight nod but doesn’t dare look me in the eye."

“It’s a fashion thing, Posy. Like wearing lipstick,” I say.
“It’s meant to be pretty,” whispers Octavia, and I can see the tears threatening to spill over her lashes.
Posy considers this and says matter-of-factly, “I think you’d be pretty in any color.”
The tiniest of smiles forms on Octavia’s lips. “Thank you.”
“If you really want to impress Posy, you’ll have to dye yourself bright pink,” says Gale, thumping his tray down beside me. “That’s her favorite color.” Posy giggles and slides back down to her mother. Gale nods at Flavius’s bowl. “I wouldn’t let that get cold. It doesn’t improve the consistency.”
Everyone gets down to eating. The stew doesn’t taste bad, but there’s a certain sliminess that’s hard to get around. Like you have to swallow every bite three times before it really goes down.
Gale, who’s not usually much of a talker during meals, makes an effort to keep the conversation going, asking about the makeover. I know it’s his attempt at smoothing things over. We argued last night after he suggested I’d left Coin no choice but to counter my demand for the victors’ safety with one of her own. “Katniss, she’s running this district. She can’t do it if it seems like she’s caving in to your will.”

Enclose an area and leave a mouth of a couple square feet. Bait the inside with nectar flowers. While they’re feeding, snap the mouth shut. They’d fly away from the noise but only encounter the far side of the net.”

I seem to have reached some new low under Plutarch and Fulvia’s guidance. Both my voice and body have a jerky, disjointed quality, like a puppet being manipulated by unseen forces.
“All right,” Haymitch says when it’s over. “Would anyone like to argue that this is of use to us in winning the war?” No one does. “That saves time. So, let’s all be quiet for a minute. I want everyone to think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle, or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot with an arrow. Not where Peeta was making you like her. I want to hear one moment where she made you feel something real.”
Quiet stretches out and I’m beginning to think it will never end, when Leevy speaks up. “When she volunteered to take Prim’s place at the reaping. Because I’m sure she thought she was going to die.”
“Good. Excellent example,” says Haymitch. He takes a purple marker and writes on a notepad. “Volunteered for sister at reaping.” Haymitch looks around the table. “Somebody else.”

I’m surprised that the next speaker is Boggs, who I think of as a muscular robot that does Coin’s bidding. “When she sang the song. While the little girl died.” Somewhere in my head an image surfaces of Boggs with a young boy perched up on his hip. In the dining hall, I think. Maybe he’s not a robot after all.
“Who didn’t get choked up at that, right?” says Haymitch, writing it down.
“I cried when she drugged Peeta so she could go get him medicine and when she kissed him good-bye!” blurts out Octavia. Then she covers her mouth, like she’s sure this was a bad mistake.
But Haymitch only nods. “Oh, yeah. Drugs Peeta to save his life. Very nice.”
The moments begin to come thick and fast and in no particular order. When I took Rue on as an ally. Extended my hand to Chaff on interview night. Tried to carry Mags. And again and again when I held out those berries that meant different things to different people. Love for Peeta. Refusal to give in under impossible odds. Defiance of the Capitol’s inhumanity.
Haymitch holds up the notepad. “So, the question is, what do all of these have in common?”
“They were Katniss’s,” says Gale quietly. “No one told her what to do or say.”
“Unscripted, yes!” says Beetee. He reaches over and pats my hand. “So we should just leave you alone, right?”
People laugh. I even smile a little.
“Well, that’s all very nice but not very helpful,” says Fulvia peevishly. “Unfortunately, her opportunities for being wonderful are rather limited here in Thirteen. So unless you’re suggesting we toss her into the middle of combat—”
“That’s exactly what I’m suggesting,” says Haymitch. “Put her out in the field and just keep the cameras rolling.”
“But people think she’s pregnant,” Gale points out.
“We’ll spread the word that she lost the baby from the electrical shock in the arena,” Plutarch replies. “Very sad. Very unfortunate.”
The idea of sending me into combat is controversial. But Haymitch has a pretty tight case. If I perform well only in real-life circumstances, then into them I should go. “Every time we coach her or give her lines, the best we can hope for is okay. It has to come from her. That’s what people are responding to.”
“Even if we’re careful, we can’t guarantee her safety,” says Boggs. “She’ll be a target for every—”
“I want to go,” I break in. “I’m no help to the rebels here.”
“And if you’re killed?” asks Coin.
“Make sure you get some footage. You can use that, anyway,” I answer.
“Fine,” says Coin. “But let’s take it one step at a time. Find the least dangerous situation that can evoke some spontaneity in you.” She walks around Command, studying the illuminated district maps that show the ongoing troop positions in the war. “Take her into Eight this afternoon. There was heavy bombing this morning, but the raid seems to have run its course. I want her armed with a squad of bodyguards. Camera crew on the ground. Haymitch, you’ll be airborne and in contact with her. Let’s see what happens there. Does anyone have any other comments?”

“I know,” he replies.
There’s a sense of incompleteness. And not because he hasn’t apologized. But because we were a team. We had a deal to keep Peeta safe. A drunken, unrealistic deal made in the dark of night, but a deal just the same. And in my heart of hearts, I know we both failed.
“Now you say it,” I tell him.
“I can’t believe you let him out of your sight that night,” says Haymitch.

Gale does look striking in the uniform, I guess. But the question just embarrasses us both, given our history. I’m trying to think of a witty comeback, when Boggs says brusquely, “Well, don’t expect us to be too impressed. We just saw Finnick Odair in his underwear.” I decide to go ahead and like Boggs."

I want to come clean and tell one weeping woman that it was all a hoax, a move in the game, but to present Peeta as a liar now would not help his image. Or mine. Or the cause.
I begin to fully understand the lengths to which people have gone to protect me. What I mean to the rebels. My ongoing struggle against the Capitol, which has so often felt like a solitary journey, has not been undertaken alone. I have had thousands upon thousands of people from the districts at my side. I was their Mockingjay long before I accepted the role.

A new sensation begins to germinate inside me. But it takes until I am standing on a table, waving my final goodbyes to the hoarse chanting of my name, to define it. Power. I have a kind of power I never knew I possessed. Snow knew it, as soon as I held out those berries. Plutarch knew when he rescued me from the arena. And Coin knows now. So much so that she must publicly remind her people that I am not in control.

“Yeah. I don’t think they’ve seen me,” I answer. “I mean, they’re not following us.”

If it belongs to Boggs, Gale’s going to pay for it dearly later on. I make the roof and drag myself onto the tar. I stop long enough to pull Gale up beside me, and then we take off for the row of machine gun nests on the street side of the warehouse. Each looks to be manned by a few rebels. We skid into a nest with a pair of soldiers, hunching down behind the barrier.
“Boggs know you’re up here?” To my left I see Paylor behind one of the guns, looking at us quizzically.
I try to be evasive without flat-out lying. “He knows where we are, all right.”
Paylor laughs. “I bet he does. You been trained in these?” She slaps the stock of her gun.

If we miss our targets, these arrows will land somewhere—probably the warehouses across the street. A fire can be put out, but the damage an explosive can do may be irreparable.
Suddenly, they appear in the sky, two blocks down, maybe a hundred yards above us. Seven small bombers in a V formation. “Geese!” I yell at Gale. He’ll know exactly what I mean. During migration season, when we hunt fowl, we’ve developed a system of dividing the birds so we don’t both target the same ones. I get the far side of the V, Gale takes the near, and we alternate shots at the front bird. There’s no time for further discussion. I estimate the lead time on the hoverplanes and let my arrow fly. I catch the inside wing of one, causing it to burst into flames. Gale just misses the point plane. A fire blooms on an empty warehouse roof across from us. He swears under his breath.
The hoverplane I hit swerves out of formation, but still releases its bombs. It doesn’t disappear, though. Neither does one other I assume was hit by gunfire. The damage must prevent the sight shield from reactivating.

“They’re growing on me,” says Gale.
I scramble down a ladder. When my feet hit the ground, I find a bodyguard, Cressida, and the other insect waiting. I expect resistance, but Cressida just waves me toward the hospital. She’s yelling, “I don’t care, Plutarch! Just give me five more minutes!” Not one to question a free pass, I take off into the street.
“Oh, no,” I whisper as I catch sight of the hospital. What used to be the hospital. I move past the wounded, past the burning plane wrecks, fixated on the disaster ahead of me. People screaming, running about frantically, but unable to help. The bombs have collapsed the hospital roof and set the building on fire, effectively trapping the patients within. A group of rescuers has assembled, trying to clear a path to the inside. But I already know what they will find. If the crushing debris and the flames didn’t get them, the smoke did.
Gale’s at my shoulder. The fact that he does nothing only confirms my suspicions. Miners don’t abandon an accident until it’s hopeless.
“Come on, Katniss. Haymitch says they can get a hovercraft in for us now,” he tells me. But I can’t seem to move.
“Why would they do that? Why would they target people who were already dying?” I ask him.
“Scare others off. Prevent the wounded from seeking help,” says Gale. “Those people you met, they were expendable. To Snow, anyway. If the Capitol wins, what will it do with a bunch of damaged slaves?”
I remember all those years in the woods, listening to Gale rant against the Capitol. Me, not paying close attention. Wondering why he even bothered to dissect its motives. Why thinking like our enemy would ever matter. Clearly, it could have mattered today. When Gale questioned the existence of the hospital, he was not thinking of disease, but this. Because he never underestimates the cruelty of those we face."

Her manner’s unrattled. Cool even. “Katniss,” she says, “President Snow just had them air the bombing live. Then he made an appearance to say that this was his way of sending a message to the rebels. What about you? Would you like to tell the rebels anything?”
“Yes,” I whisper. The red blinking light on one of the cameras catches my eye. I know I’m being recorded. “Yes,” I say more forcefully. Everyone is drawing away from me—Gale, Cressida, the insects—giving me the stage. But I stay focused on the red light. “I want to tell the rebels that I am alive. That I’m right here in District Eight, where the Capitol has just bombed a hospital full of unarmed men, women, and children. There will be no survivors.” The shock I’ve been feeling begins to give way to fury. “I want to tell people that if you think for one second the Capitol will treat us fairly if there’s a cease-fire, you’re deluding yourself. Because you know who they are and what they do.” My hands go out automatically, as if to indicate the whole horror around me. “This is what they do! And we must fight back!”
I’m moving in toward the camera now, carried forward by my rage. “President Snow says he’s sending us a message? Well, I have one for him. You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that?” One of the cameras follows as I point to the planes burning on the roof of the warehouse across from us. The Capitol seal on a wing glows clearly through the flames. “Fire is catching!” I am shouting now, determined that he will not miss a word. “And if we burn, you burn with us!”
My last words hang in the air. I feel suspended in time. Held aloft in a cloud of heat that generates not from my surroundings, but from my own being.

I explain how I didn’t know their names, but their suits suggested the shelled creatures. The comparison doesn’t seem to bother them. Even without the camera shells, they strongly resemble each other. Same sandy hair, red beards, and blue eyes. The one with close-bitten nails introduces himself as Castor and the other, who’s his brother, as Pollux. I wait for Pollux to say hello, but he just nods. At first I think he’s shy or a man of few words. But something tugs on me—the position of his lips, the extra effort he takes to swallow—and I know before Castor tells me. Pollux is an Avox.

Gale has to kick me under the table before I realize that she’s talking to me. “Oh! Yeah, I’m completely all right with that. It felt good. Doing something for a change.”

Plutarch nods to Cressida, who consults a clipboard. “We have some terrific footage of Katniss at the hospital in Eight. There should be another propo in that with the theme ‘Because you know who they are and what they do.’ We’ll focus on Katniss interacting with the patients, particularly the children, the bombing of the hospital, and the wreckage. Messalla’s cutting that together. We’re also thinking about a Mockingjay piece. Highlight some of Katniss’s best moments intercut with scenes of rebel uprisings and war footage. We call that one ‘Fire is catching.’ And then Fulvia came up with a really brilliant idea.”
Fulvia’s mouthful-of-sour-grapes expression is startled right off her face, but she recovers. “Well, I don’t know how brilliant it is, but I was thinking we could do a series of propos called We Remember. In each one, we would feature one of the dead tributes. Little Rue from Eleven or old Mags from Four. The idea being that we could target each district with a very personal piece.”
“A tribute to your tributes, as it were,” says Plutarch.
“That is brilliant, Fulvia,” I say sincerely. “It’s the perfect way to remind people why they’re fighting.”
“I think it could work,” she says. “I thought we might use Finnick to intro and narrate the spots. If there was interest in them.”
“Frankly, I don’t see how we could have too many We Remember propos,” says Coin. “Can you start producing them today?”
“Of course,” says Fulvia, obviously mollified by the response to her idea.
Cressida has smoothed everything over in the creative department with her gesture. Praised Fulvia for what is, in fact, a really good idea, and cleared the way to continue her own on-air depiction of the Mockingjay. What’s interesting is that Plutarch seems to have no need to share in the credit. All he wants is for the Airtime Assault to work. I remember that Plutarch is a Head Gamemaker, not a member of the crew. Not a piece in the Games. Therefore, his worth is not defined by a single element, but by the overall success of the production. If we win the war, that’s when Plutarch will take his bow. And expect his reward."

It’s hard to watch my reception in the hospital in 8 since I know what’s coming. When the bombs rain down on the roof, I bury my face in my pillow, looking up again at a brief clip of me at the end, after all the victims are dead.
At least Finnick doesn’t applaud or act all happy when it’s done. He just says, “People should know that happened. And now they do.”
“Let’s turn it off, Finnick, before they run it again,” I urge him. But as Finnick’s hand moves toward the remote control, I cry, “Wait!” The Capitol is introducing a special segment and something about it looks familiar. Yes, it’s Caesar Flickerman. And I can guess who his guest will be.
Peeta’s physical transformation shocks me. The healthy, clear-eyed boy I saw a few days ago has lost at least fifteen pounds and developed a nervous tremor in his hands. They’ve still got him groomed. But underneath the paint that cannot cover the bags under his eyes, and the fine clothes that cannot conceal the pain he feels when he moves, is a person badly damaged.

My mind reels, trying to make sense of it. I just saw him! Four—no, five—I think it was five days ago. How has he deteriorated so rapidly? What could they possibly have done to him in such a short time? Then it hits me. I replay in my mind as much as I can of his first interview with Caesar, searching for anything that would place it in time. There is nothing. They could have taped that interview a day or two after I blew up the arena, then done whatever they wanted to do to him ever since. “Oh, Peeta…” I whisper.
Caesar and Peeta have a few empty exchanges before Caesar asks him about rumors that I’m taping propos for the districts. “They’re using her, obviously,” says Peeta. “To whip up the rebels. I doubt she even really knows what’s going on in the war. What’s at stake.”
“Is there anything you’d like to tell her?” asks Caesar.
“There is,” says Peeta. He looks directly into the camera, right into my eyes. “Don’t be a fool, Katniss. Think for yourself. They’ve turned you into a weapon that could be instrumental in the destruction of humanity. If you’ve got any real influence, use it to put the brakes on this thing. Use it to stop the war before it’s too late. Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you’re working with? Do you really know what’s going on? And if you don’t…find out.”
Black screen. Seal of Panem. Show over.
Finnick presses the button on the remote that kills the power. In a minute, people will be here to do damage control on Peeta’s condition and the words that came out of his mouth. I will need to repudiate them. But the truth is, I don’t trust the rebels or Plutarch or Coin. I’m not confident that they tell me the truth. I won’t be able to conceal this. Footsteps are approaching.
Finnick grips me hard by the arms. “We didn’t see it.”
“What?” I ask.
“We didn’t see Peeta. Only the propo on Eight. Then we turned the set off because the images upset you. Got it?” he asks. I nod. “Finish your dinner.” I pull myself together enough so that when Plutarch and Fulvia enter, I have a mouthful of bread and cabbage.

So, before I actually think about what I’m doing, I sing Rue’s four notes, the ones she used to signal the end of the workday in 11. The notes that ended up as the background music to her murder. The birds don’t know that. They pick up the simple phrase and bounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmony. Just as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttations broke through the trees, chased us onto the Cornucopia, and slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp—

“Want to hear them do a real song?” I burst out. Anything to stop those memories. I’m on my feet, moving back into the trees, resting my hand on the rough trunk of a maple where the birds perch. I have not sung “The Hanging Tree” out loud for ten years, because it’s forbidden, but I remember every word. I begin softly, sweetly, as my father did.

“Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”

The mockingjays begin to alter their songs as they become aware of my new offering.

“Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love to flee.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”

I have the birds’ attention now. In one more verse, surely they will have captured the melody, as it’s simple and repeats four times with little variation.


“Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run, so we’d both be free.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”

A hush in the trees. Just the rustle of leaves in the breeze. But no birds, mockingjay or other. Peeta’s right. They do fall silent when I sing. Just as they did for my father.

“Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”

The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that’s it. Last verse. In the stillness I remember the scene. I was home from a day in the woods with my father. Sitting on the floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing “The Hanging Tree.” Making us necklaces out of scraps of old rope like it said in the song, not knowing the real meaning of the words. The tune was simple and easy to harmonize to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything set to music after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled, and then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had exactly one hiding spot—in the Meadow under a honeysuckle bush—my father found me immediately. He calmed me down and told me everything was fine, only we’d better not sing that song anymore. My mother just wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every word was immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.
We didn’t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it’s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer’s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That’s weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it’s not until the third verse that “The Hanging Tree” begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He’s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she’s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we’d both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he’s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it’s clear that that’s what he’s waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.

I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he’d be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn’t I want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I couldn’t think of another at the time.
I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who made her own rope necklaces. It wasn’t like hanging was something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn’t want me singing it in front of my music class. She probably wouldn’t like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least I’m not—wait, no, I’m wrong. As I glance sideways, I see Castor has been taping me. Everyone is watching me intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some terrible incident in his life. Great. I sigh and lean back against the trunk. That’s when the mockingjays begin their rendition of “The Hanging Tree.” In their mouths, it’s quite beautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I hear Cressida call, “Cut!”

He’s sitting in an elevated chair, his shoes supported by a metal rung. The foot of his prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat. Beads of sweat have broken through the layer of powder on his upper lip and forehead. But it’s the look in his eyes—angry yet unfocused—that frightens me the most.
“He’s worse,” I whisper. Finnick grasps my hand, to give me an anchor, and I try to hang on.
Peeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about the need for the cease-fire. He highlights the damage done to key infrastructure in various districts, and as he speaks, parts of the map light up, showing images of the destruction. A broken dam in 7. A derailed train with a pool of toxic waste spilling from the tank cars. A granary collapsing after a fire. All of these he attributes to rebel action.
Bam! Without warning, I’m suddenly on television, standing in the rubble of the bakery.
Plutarch jumps to his feet. “He did it! Beetee broke in!”
The room’s buzzing with reaction when Peeta’s back, distracted. He has seen me on the monitor. He tries to pick up his speech by moving on to the bombing of a water purification plant, when a clip of Finnick talking about Rue replaces him. And then the whole thing breaks down into a broadcast battle, as the Capitol tech masters try to fend off Beetee’s attack. But they are unprepared, and Beetee, apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control, has an arsenal of five- to ten-second clips to work with. We watch the official presentation deteriorate as it’s peppered with choice shots from the propos.
Plutarch’s in spasms of delight and most everybody is cheering Beetee on, but Finnick remains still and speechless beside me. I meet Haymitch’s eyes from across the room and see my own dread mirrored back. The recognition that with every cheer, Peeta slips even farther from our grasp"

Is she thinking of my father’s being blown to nothingness in the mines? “It was a close call, though. Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us.”
The wherewithal. A general term that somehow includes everything that was needed for him to sound the alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. And something else I can’t define. Peeta seemed to have been waging a sort of battle in his mind, fighting to get the message out. Why? The ease with which he manipulates words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of his torture? Something more? Like madness?
Coin’s voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the bunker, the volume level flickering with the lights. “Apparently, Peeta Mellark’s information was sound and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first missile was not nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more will follow. For the duration of the attack, citizens are to stay in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified.”
A soldier alerts my mother that she’s needed in the first-aid station. She’s reluctant to leave us, even though she’ll only be thirty yards away.

Buttercup, miserable even with Prim’s constant attention, huddles in the cube and exhales cat breath in my face.
Despite the disagreeable conditions, I’m glad to have time with my sister. My extreme preoccupation since I came here—no, since the first Games, really—has left little attention for her. I haven’t been watching over her the way I should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked our compartment, not me. Something to make up for.
I realize I’ve never even bothered to ask her about how she’s handling the shock of coming here. “So, how are you liking Thirteen, Prim?” I offer.
“Right now?” she asks. We both laugh. “I miss home badly sometimes. But then I remember there’s nothing left to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don’t have to worry about you. Well, not the same way.” She pauses, and then a shy smile crosses her lips. “I think they’re going to train me to be a doctor.”
It’s the first I’ve heard of it. “Well, of course, they are. They’d be stupid not to.”
“They’ve been watching me when I help out in the hospital. I’m already taking the medic courses. It’s just beginner’s stuff. I know a lot of it from home. Still, there’s plenty to learn,” she tells me.

“That’s great,” I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn’t even dream of it in 12. Something small and quiet, like a match being struck, lights up the gloom inside me. This is the sort of future a rebellion could bring.
“What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?” Her fingertip moves in short, gentle strokes between Buttercup’s eyes. “And don’t say you’re fine.”
It’s true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that’s what I am. So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta, his deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must be killing him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for a while, because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling me closer, brushing the hair back behind my ears with her fingers. I’ve stopped talking because there’s really nothing left to say and there’s this piercing sort of pain where my heart is. Maybe I’m even having a heart attack, but it doesn’t seem worth mentioning.
“Katniss, I don’t think President Snow will kill Peeta,” she says. Of course, she says this; it’s what she thinks will calm me. But her next words come as a surprise. “If he does, he won’t have anyone left you want. He won’t have any way to hurt you.”
Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer. Johanna Mason, the tribute from District 7, in the last arena. I was trying to prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she brushed me off, saying, “They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no one left I love.”

Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to waste Peeta’s life, especially now, while the Mockingjay causes so much havoc. He’s killed Cinna already. Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch are out of his reach. Peeta’s all he has left.

Crazy Cat becomes a metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, the thing I want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under his paws, he’s bristling with aggression. (That’s how I’ve been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.) When the light goes out completely, Buttercup’s temporarily distraught and confused, but he recovers and moves on to other things. (That’s what would happen if Peeta died.) But the one thing that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on the wall, beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall, wails, and can’t be comforted or distracted. He’s useless until I shut the light off. (That’s what Snow is trying to do to me now, only I don’t know what form his game takes.)
Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs. Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinking that he’s being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is unendurable. And it’s under the weight of this revelation that I truly begin to break.
After Crazy Cat, we’re directed to bed. The power’s been coming and going; sometimes the lamps burn at full brightness, other times we squint at one another in the brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness and activate safety lights in each space. Prim, who’s decided the walls will hold up, snuggles with Buttercup on the lower bunk. My mother’s on the upper. I offer to take a bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I flail around so much when I’m sleeping.
I’m not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the tension of holding myself together. The pain over my heart returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over my face, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange, razor-sharp shards.
When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into sleep, I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe through the cavern until I find Finnick, feeling for some unspecified reason that he will understand. He sits under the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even pretending to rest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow’s plan to break me, it dawns on me. This strategy is very old news to Finnick. It’s what broke him.
“This is what they’re doing to you with Annie, isn’t it?” I ask.
“Well, they didn’t arrest her because they thought she’d be a wealth of rebel information,” he says. “They know I’d never have risked telling her anything like that. For her own protection.”
“Oh, Finnick. I’m so sorry,” I say.
“No, I’m sorry. That I didn’t warn you somehow,” he tells me.
Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I’m strapped to my bed, mad with rage and grief after the rescue. Finnick is trying to console me about Peeta. “They’ll figure out he doesn’t know anything pretty fast. And they won’t kill him if they think they can use him against you.”
“You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only when you said they’d use Peeta against me, I thought you meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow,” I say.
“I shouldn’t have said even that. It was too late for it to be of any help to you. Since I hadn’t warned you before the Quarter Quell, I should’ve shut up about how Snow operates.” Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an intricate knot becomes a straight line again. “It’s just that I didn’t understand when I met you. After your first Games, I thought the whole romance was an act on your part. We all expected you’d continue that strategy. But it wasn’t until Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I—” Finnick hesitates.

I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick revived Peeta. The quizzical look on Finnick’s face. The way he excused my behavior, blaming it on my pretend pregnancy. “That you what?”
“That I knew I’d misjudged you. That you do love him. I’m not saying in what way. Maybe you don’t know yourself"

Anyone? On Snow’s visit before the Victory Tour, he challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta. “Convince me,” Snow said. It seems, under that hot pink sky with Peeta’s life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I gave him the weapon he needed to break me.
Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the knots bloom and vanish, before I can ask, “How do you bear it?”
Finnick looks at me in disbelief. “I don’t, Katniss! Obviously, I don’t. I drag myself out of nightmares each morning and find there’s no relief in waking.” Something in my expression stops him. “Better not to give in to it. It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.”
Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing myself back into one piece.
“The more you can distract yourself, the better,” he says. “First thing tomorrow, we’ll get you your own rope. Until then, take mine.”
I spend the rest of the night on my mattress obsessively making knots, holding them up for Buttercup’s inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out of the air and bites it a few times to make sure it’s dead. By morning, my fingers are sore, but I’m still holding on."

There’s no small talk. “We need all four of you suited up and aboveground,” says the president. “You have two hours to get footage showing the damage from the bombing, establish that Thirteen’s military unit remains not only functional but dominant, and, most important, that the Mockingjay is still alive.

Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at the shiny black liquid, never having been much of a fan of the stuff, but thinking it might help me stay on my feet. Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into the sugar bowl. “Want a sugar cube?” he asks in his old seductive voice. That’s how we met, with Finnick offering me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumed and painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I had any idea what made him tick.

Because now I know that everything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta. Result in his torture. But not his death, no, nothing so merciful as that. Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.

“Cut,” I hear Cressida say quietly.
“What’s wrong with her?” Plutarch says under his breath.
“She’s figured out how Snow’s using Peeta,” says Finnick.
There’s something like a collective sigh of regret from the semicircle of people spread out before me. Because I know this now. Because there will never be a way for me to not know this again. Because, beyond the military disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails, I am broken.
Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch, because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say something like his name and he’s there, holding me and patting my back. “It’s okay. It’ll be okay, sweetheart.” He sits me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm around me while I sob.
“I can’t do this anymore,” I say.
“I know,” he says.
“All I can think of is—what he’s going to do to Peeta—because I’m the Mockingjay!” I get out.
“I know.” Haymitch’s arm tightens around me.
“Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they—doing to him?” I’m gasping for air between sobs, but I manage one last phrase. “It’s my fault!” And then I cross some line into hysteria and there’s a needle in my arm and the world slips away.
It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because it’s a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn’t peaceful, though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark, haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.
Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. “It’s all right. We’re going to try to get Peeta out.”
“What?” That makes no sense.
“Plutarch’s sending in a rescue team. He has people on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive,” he says.
“Why didn’t we before?” I say.
“Because it’s costly. But everyone agrees this is the thing to do. It’s the same choice we made in the arena. To do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can’t lose the Mockingjay now. And you can’t perform unless you know Snow can’t take it out on Peeta.” Haymitch offers me a cup. “Here, drink something.”
I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. “What do you mean, costly?”
He shrugs. “Covers will be blown. People may die. But keep in mind that they’re dying every day. And it’s not just Peeta; we’re getting Annie out for Finnick, too.”
“Where is he?” I ask.
“Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost it right after we knocked you out,” says Haymitch. I smile a little, feel a bit less weak. “Yeah, it was a really excellent shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange the mission to get Peeta. We’re officially in reruns.”
“Well, if Boggs is leading it, that’s a plus,” I say.
“Oh, he’s on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he pretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air,” says Haymitch. “See? He’s already demonstrated good judgment.”

Something’s wrong. Haymitch’s trying a little too hard to cheer me up. It’s not really his style. “So who else volunteered?”
“I think there were seven altogether,” he says evasively.
I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. “Who else, Haymitch?” I insist.
Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. “You know who else, Katniss. You know who stepped up first.”
Of course I do.

I try to imagine a world where both Gale’s and Peeta’s voices have ceased. Hands stilled. Eyes unblinking. I’m standing over their bodies, having a last look, leaving the room where they lie. But when I open the door to step out into the world, there’s only a tremendous void. A pale gray nothingness that is all my future holds.
“Do you want me to have them sedate you until it’s over?” asks Haymitch. He’s not joking. This is a man who spent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle, trying to anesthetize himself against the Capitol’s crimes. The sixteen-year-old boy who won the second Quarter Quell must have had people he loved—family, friends, a sweetheart maybe—that he fought to get back to. Where are they now? How is it that until Peeta and I were thrust upon him, there was no one at all in his life? What did Snow do to them?
“No,” I say. “I want to go to the Capitol. I want to be part of the rescue mission.”
“They’re gone,” says Haymitch.
“How long ago did they leave? I could catch up. I could—” What? What could I do?

Haymitch shakes his head. “It’ll never happen. You’re too valuable and too vulnerable. There was talk of sending you to another district to divert the Capitol’s attention while the rescue takes place. But no one felt you could handle it.”
“Please, Haymitch!” I’m begging now. “I have to do something. I can’t just sit here waiting to hear if they died. There must be something I can do!”

Although it’s cowardly—cruel even—to rouse him from the shadowy, muted drug land to stark reality, I go ahead and do it because I can’t stand to face this by myself.
As I explain our situation, his initial agitation mysteriously ebbs. “Don’t you see, Katniss, this will decide things. One way or the other. By the end of the day, they’ll either be dead or with us. It’s…it’s more than we could hope for!”
Well, that’s a sunny view of our situation. And yet there’s something calming about the idea that this torment could come to an end.
The curtain yanks back and there’s Haymitch. He has a job for us, if we can pull it together. They still need post-bombing footage of 13. “If we can get it in the next few hours, Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue, and maybe keep the Capitol’s attention elsewhere.”

“Yes, a distraction,” says Finnick. “A decoy of sorts.”
“What we really need is something so riveting that even President Snow won’t be able to tear himself away. Got anything like that?” asks Haymitch.
Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into focus. While I knock down breakfast and get prepped, I try to think of what I might say. President Snow must be wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are affecting me. If he wants me broken, then I will have to be whole. But I don’t think I will convince him of anything by shouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera. Besides, that won’t buy the rescue team any time. Outbursts are short. It’s stories that take time.
I don’t know if it will work, but when the television crew’s all assembled aboveground, I ask Cressida if she could start out by asking me about Peeta. I take a seat on the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown, wait for the red light and Cressida’s question.
“How did you meet Peeta?” she asks.
And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since my first interview. I open up. “When I met Peeta, I was eleven years old, and I was almost dead.” I talk about that awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain, how Peeta’s mother chased me from the bakery door, and how he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread that saved our lives. “We had never even spoken. The first time I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games.”

“Not well. I know at any moment Snow could kill him. Especially since he warned Thirteen about the bombing. It’s a terrible thing to live with,” I say. “But because of what they’re putting him through, I don’t have any reservations anymore. About doing whatever it takes to destroy the Capitol. I’m finally free.” I turn my gaze skyward and watch the flight of a hawk across the sky. “President Snow once admitted to me that the Capitol was fragile. At the time, I didn’t know what he meant. It was hard to see clearly because I was so afraid. Now I’m not. The Capitol’s fragile because it depends on the districts for everything. Food, energy, even the Peacekeepers that police us. If we declare our freedom, the Capitol collapses. President Snow, thanks to you, I’m officially declaring mine today.”
I’ve been sufficient, if not dazzling. Everyone loves the bread story"

He hastily calls Finnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intense conversation that I can see Haymitch isn’t happy with. Plutarch seems to win—Finnick’s pale but nodding his head by the end of it.
As Finnick moves to take my seat before the camera, Haymitch tells him, “You don’t have to do this.”
“Yes, I do. If it will help her.” Finnick balls up his rope in his hand. “I’m ready.”

I don’t know what to expect. A love story about Annie? An account of the abuses in District 4? But Finnick Odair takes a completely different tack.
“President Snow used to…sell me…my body, that is,” Finnick begins in a flat, removed tone. “I wasn’t the only one. If a victor is considered desirable, the president gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an exorbitant amount of money. If you refuse, he kills someone you love. So you do it.”
That explains it, then. Finnick’s parade of lovers in the Capitol. They were never real lovers. Just people like our old Head Peacekeeper, Cray, who bought desperate girls to devour and discard because he could. I want to interrupt the taping and beg Finnick’s forgiveness for every false thought I’ve ever had about him. But we have a job to do, and I sense Finnick’s role will be far more effective than mine.
“I wasn’t the only one, but I was the most popular,” he says. “And perhaps the most defenseless, because the people I loved were so defenseless. To make themselves feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or jewelry, but I found a much more valuable form of payment.”
Secrets, I think. That’s what Finnick told me his lovers paid him in, only I thought the whole arrangement was by his choice.
“Secrets,” he says, echoing my thoughts. “And this is where you’re going to want to stay tuned, President Snow, because so very many of them were about you. But let’s begin with some of the others.”

Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that you can’t doubt its authenticity. Tales of strange sexual appetites, betrayals of the heart, bottomless greed, and bloody power plays. Drunken secrets whispered over damp pillow-cases in the dead of night. Finnick was someone bought and sold. A district slave. A handsome one, certainly, but in reality, harmless. Who would he tell? And who would believe him if he did? But some secrets are too delicious not to share. I don’t know the people Finnick names—all seem to be prominent Capitol citizens—but I know, from listening to the chatter of my prep team, the attention the most mild slip in judgment can draw. If a bad haircut can lead to hours of gossip, what will charges of incest, back-stabbing, blackmail, and arson produce? Even as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over the Capitol, the people there will be waiting, as I am now, to hear about the president.

Such a clever one to keep it. How, you must ask yourself, did he do it? One word. That’s all you really need to know. Poison.” Finnick goes back to Snow’s political ascension, which I know nothing of, and works his way up to the present, pointing out case after case of the mysterious deaths of Snow’s adversaries or, even worse, his allies who had the potential to become threats. People dropping dead at a feast or slowly, inexplicably declining into shadows over a period of months. Blamed on bad shellfish, elusive viruses, or an overlooked weakness in the aorta. Snow drinking from the poisoned cup himself to deflect suspicion. But antidotes don’t always work. They say that’s why he wears the roses that reek of perfume. They say it’s to cover the scent of blood from the mouth sores that will never heal. They say, they say, they say…Snow has a list and no one knows who will be next.
Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.
Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president are already so low, I can’t say Finnick’s allegations shock me. They seem to have far more effect on the displaced Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia—even Plutarch occasionally reacts in surprise, maybe wondering how a specific tidbit passed him by. When Finnick finishes, they just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be the one to say “Cut.”

I’m left with Haymitch in the rubble, wondering if Finnick’s fate would have one day been mine. Why not? Snow could have gotten a really good price for the girl on fire.
“Is that what happened to you?” I ask Haymitch.
“No. My mother and younger brother. My girl. They were all dead two weeks after I was crowned victor. Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field,” he answers. “Snow had no one to use against me.”
“I’m surprised he didn’t just kill you,” I say.
“Oh, no. I was the example. The person to hold up to the young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres. Of what could happen to a victor who caused problems,” says Haymitch. “But he knew he had no leverage against me.”
“Until Peeta and I came along,” I say softly. I don’t even get a shrug in return."

His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with a determination I have never seen. Most of my interview doesn’t make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and still defiant. It is Finnick’s salacious and gory account of the Capitol that takes the day. Is Beetee’s skill improving? Or are his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated to want to tune Finnick out? For the next sixty minutes, the Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon newscast, Finnick, and attempts to black it all out. But the rebel techno team manages to override even the latter and, in a real coup, keeps control for almost the entire attack on Snow.
“Let it go!” says Beetee, throwing up his hands, relinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol. He mops his face with a cloth. “If they’re not out of there by now, they’re all dead.” He spins in his chair to see Finnick and me reacting to his words. “It was a good plan, though. Did Plutarch show it to you?”

Of course not. Beetee takes us to another room and shows us how the team, with the help of rebel insiders, will attempt—has attempted—to free the victors from an underground prison. It seems to have involved knockout gas distributed by the ventilation system, a power failure, the detonation of a bomb in a government building several miles from the prison, and now the disruption of the broadcast. Beetee’s glad we find the plan hard to follow, because then our enemies will, too."

I want to run, but Finnick’s acting so strange, as if he’s lost the ability to move, so I take his hand and lead him like a small child.

A lovely if somewhat bedraggled young woman—dark tangled hair, sea green eyes—runs toward us in nothing but a sheet. “Finnick!” And suddenly, it’s as if there’s no one in the world but these two, crashing through space to reach each other. They collide, enfold, lose their balance, and slam against a wall, where they stay. Clinging into one being. Indivisible.
A pang of jealousy hits me. Not for either Finnick or Annie but for their certainty. No one seeing them could doubt their love.

It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow before any permanent damage could be done. I know Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadn’t been utterly unprepared. To catch both Haymitch and myself off guard is a rare thing. But we have been so consumed with saving Peeta, so tortured by having him in the Capitol’s hands, that the elation at having him back blinded us.

Obviously, he’d been abused, and we put his psychological state down to that. Now we believe something more was going on. That the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon technique known as hijacking. Beetee?”
“I’m sorry,” Beetee says, “but I can’t tell you all the specifics of it, Katniss. The Capitol’s very secretive about this form of torture, and I believe the results are inconsistent. This we do know. It’s a type of fear conditioning. The term hijack comes from an old English word that means ‘to capture,’ or even better, ‘seize.’ We believe it was chosen because the technique involves the use of tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested hijack. You were stung in your first Hunger Games, so unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of the effects of the venom.”
Terror. Hallucinations. Nightmarish visions of losing those I love. Because the venom targets the part of the brain that houses fear.
“I’m sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath?” asks Beetee. “A sense of being unable to judge what was true and what was false? Most people who have been stung and lived to tell about it report something of the kind.”
Yes. That encounter with Peeta. Even after I was clearheaded, I wasn’t sure if he had saved my life by taking on Cato or if I’d imagined it.
“Recall is made more difficult because memories can be changed.” Beetee taps his forehead. “Brought to the forefront of your mind, altered, and saved again in the revised form. Now imagine that I ask you to remember something—either with a verbal suggestion or by making you watch a tape of the event—and while that experience is refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not enough to induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to infuse the memory with fear and doubt. And that’s what your brain puts in long-term storage.”
I start to feel sick. Prim asks the question that’s in my mind. “Is that what they’ve done to Peeta? Taken his memories of Katniss and distorted them so they’re scary?”
Beetee nods. “So scary that he’d see her as life-threatening. That he might try to kill her. Yes, that’s our current theory.”
I cover my face with my arms because this isn’t happening. It isn’t possible. For someone to make Peeta forget he loves me…no one could do that.
“But you can reverse it, right?” asks Prim.
“Um…very little data on that,” says Plutarch. “None, really. If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted before, we have no access to those records.”
“Well, you’re going to try, aren’t you?” Prim persists. “You’re not just going to lock him up in some padded room and leave him to suffer?”
“Of course, we’ll try, Prim,” says Beetee. “It’s just, we don’t know to what degree we’ll succeed. If any. My guess is that fearful events are the hardest to root out. They’re the ones we naturally remember the best, after all.”
“And apart from his memories of Katniss, we don’t yet know what else has been tampered with,” says Plutarch. “We’re putting together a team of mental health and military professionals to come up with a counterattack. I, personally, feel optimistic that he’ll make a full recovery.”

I shift my arms slightly so I can see his expression through the crack. He’s exhausted and discouraged as he admits, “I think Peeta might get somewhat better. But…I don’t think he’ll ever be the same.” I snap my arms back together, closing the crack, shutting them all out.
“At least he’s alive,” says Plutarch, as if he’s losing patience with the lot of us. “Snow executed Peeta’s stylist and his prep team on live television tonight. We’ve no idea what happened to Effie Trinket. Peeta’s damaged, but he’s here. With us. And that’s a definite improvement over his situation twelve hours ago. Let’s keep that in mind, all right?”
Plutarch’s attempt to cheer me up—laced with the news of another four, possibly five, murders—somehow backfires. Portia. Peeta’s prep team. Effie. The effort to fight back tears makes my throat throb until I’m gasping again. Eventually, they have no choice but to sedate me.
When I wake, I wonder if this will be the only way I sleep now, with drugs shot into my arm. I’m glad I’m not supposed to talk for the next few days, because there’s nothing I want to say. Or do.

Tacked on the corkboard walls and occupying several computer screens are other designs of some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale’s twitch-up snare. “What are these?” I ask hoarsely, pulling their attention from the sheet.
“Ah, Katniss, you’ve found us out,” says Beetee cheerfully.
“What? Is this a secret?” I know Gale’s been down here working with Beetee a lot, but I assumed they were messing around with bows and guns.
“Not really. But I’ve felt a little guilty about it. Stealing Gale away from you so much,” Beetee admits.
Since I’ve spent most of my time in 13 disoriented, worried, angry, being remade, or hospitalized, I can’t say Gale’s absences have inconvenienced me. Things haven’t been exactly harmonious between us, either. But I let Beetee think he owes me. “I hope you’ve been putting his time to good use.”
“Come and see,” he says, waving me over to a computer screen.
This is what they’ve been doing. Taking the fundamental ideas behind Gale’s traps and adapting them into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It’s less about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology behind them. Booby-trapping an area that provides something essential to survival. A water or food supply. Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater destruction. Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the actual desired target, the parent. Luring the victim into what appears to be a safe haven—where death awaits it. At some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind and focused on more human impulses. Like compassion. A bomb explodes. Time is allowed for people to rush to the aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bomb kills them as well.
“That seems to be crossing some kind of line,” I say. “So anything goes?” They both stare at me—Beetee with doubt, Gale with hostility. “I guess there isn’t a rule book for what might be unacceptable to do to another human being.”
“Sure there is. Beetee and I have been following the same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked Peeta,” says Gale.
Cruel, but to the point. I leave without further comment. I feel if I don’t get outside immediately, I’ll just go ballistic, but I’m still in Special Defense when I’m waylaid by Haymitch. “Come on,” he says. “We need you back up at the hospital.”
“What for?” I ask.
“They’re going to try something on Peeta,” he answers. “Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can come up with. Find someone Peeta might share childhood memories with, but nothing too close to you. They’re screening people now.”
I know this will be a difficult task, since anyone Peeta shares childhood memories with would most likely be from town, and almost none of those people escaped the flames. But when we reach the hospital room that has been turned into a work space for Peeta’s recovery team, there she sits chatting with Plutarch. Delly Cartwright. As always, she gives me a smile that suggests I’m her best friend in the world. She gives this smile to everyone. “Katniss!” she calls out.
“Hey, Delly,” I say. I’d heard she and her younger brother had survived. Her parents, who ran the shoe shop in town, weren’t as lucky. She looks older, wearing the drab 13 clothes that flatter no one, with her long yellow hair in a practical braid instead of curls. Delly’s a bit thinner than I remember, but she was one of the few kids in District 12 with a couple of pounds to spare. The diet here, the stress, the grief of losing her parents have all, no doubt, contributed. “How are you doing?” I ask.
“Oh, it’s been a lot of changes all at once.” Her eyes fill with tears. “But everyone’s really nice here in Thirteen, don’t you think?”
Delly means it. She genuinely likes people. All people, not just a select few she’s spent years making up her mind about.
“They’ve made an effort to make us feel welcome,” I say. I think that’s a fair statement without going overboard. “Are you the one they’ve picked to see Peeta?”
“I guess so. Poor Peeta. Poor you. I’ll never understand the Capitol,” she says.
“Better not to, maybe,” I tell her."

“Oh, yes!” Delly’s face brightens. “We played together from when we were little. I used to tell people he was my brother.”
“What do you think?” Haymitch asks me. “Anything that might trigger memories of you?”

“We were all in the same class. But we never overlapped much,” I say.
“Katniss was always so amazing, I never dreamed she would notice me,” says Delly. “The way she could hunt and go in the Hob and everything. Everyone admired her so.”
Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her face to double-check if she’s joking. To hear Delly describe it, I had next to no friends because I intimidated people by being so exceptional. Not true. I had next to no friends because I wasn’t friendly. Leave it to Delly to spin me into something wonderful.
“Delly always thinks the best of everyone,” I explain. “I don’t think Peeta could have bad memories associated with her.” Then I remember. “Wait. In the Capitol. When I lied about recognizing the Avox girl. Peeta covered for me and said she looked like Delly.”
“I remember,” says Haymitch. “But I don’t know. It wasn’t true. Delly wasn’t actually there. I don’t think it can compete with years of childhood memories.”
“Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly,” says Plutarch. “Let’s give it a shot.”

Just by looking at the District 2 rebels, you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers. Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the people of 2 swallowed the Capitol’s propaganda more easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who formed the backbone of the resistance here."

The outer villages are in rebel hands, the town divided, and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its few entrances heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain. While every other district has now wrested control from the Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.
Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I’m not allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in 13. It’s much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm, fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel villages or surrounding caves. For safety’s sake, I’m relocated often. During the day, I’ve been given clearance to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don’t stray too far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.
Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond recognition, and made me a present of him. Boggs, who came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting, it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13 hadn’t made the effort, Peeta would’ve been delivered to me anyway. Dropped off in an actively warring district or perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my name. Programmed to murder me.
It’s only now that he’s been corrupted that I can fully appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would’ve if he’d died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and Gale, how many people in the world love me unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be none. Sometimes when I’m alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a name to the thing I’ve lost. But what’s the use? It’s gone. He’s gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that’s left is my promise to kill Snow. I tell myself this ten times a day.

Even though I don’t ask, Plutarch gives me cheerful updates on the phone like “Good news, Katniss! I think we’ve almost got him convinced you’re not a mutt!” Or “Today he was allowed to feed himself pudding!”
When Haymitch gets on after, he admits Peeta’s no better. The only dubious ray of hope has come from my sister. “Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack him back,” Haymitch tells me. “Bring up the distorted memories of you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug, like morphling. We’ve only tried it on one memory. The tape of the two of you in the cave, when you told him that story about getting Prim the goat.”

“Any improvement?” I ask.
“Well, if extreme confusion is an improvement over extreme terror, then yes,” says Haymitch. “But I’m not sure it is. He lost the ability to speak for several hours. Went into some sort of stupor. When he came out, the only thing he asked about was the goat.”

Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee. I told him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed.

His lips brushing the faded bruises on my neck, working their way to my mouth. Despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep down that he’ll never come back to me. Or I’ll never go back to him. I’ll stay in 2 until it falls, go to the Capitol and kill Snow, and then die for my trouble. And he’ll die insane and hating me. So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kiss Gale to make up for all the kisses I’ve withheld, and because it doesn’t matter anymore, and because I’m so desperately lonely I can’t stand it.
Gale’s touch and taste and heat remind me that at least my body’s still alive, and for the moment it’s a welcome feeling. I empty my mind and let the sensations run through my flesh, happy to lose myself. When Gale pulls away slightly, I move forward to close the gap, but I feel his hand under my chin. “Katniss,” he says. The instant I open my eyes, the world seems disjointed. This is not our woods or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion. “Now kiss me.” Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly. He examines my face closely. “What’s going on in your head?”
“I don’t know,” I whisper back.
“Then it’s like kissing someone who’s drunk. It doesn’t count,” he says with a weak attempt at a laugh. He scoops up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms, returning me to myself.
“How do you know?” I say, mostly to cover my embarrassment. “Have you kissed someone who’s drunk?” I guess Gale could’ve been kissing girls right and left back in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about it much before.
He just shakes his head. “No. But it’s not hard to imagine.”
“So, you never kissed any other girls?” I ask.
“I didn’t say that. You know, you were only twelve when we met. And a real pain besides. I did have a life outside of hunting with you,” he says, loading up with firewood.
Suddenly, I’m genuinely curious. “Who did you kiss? And where?”
“Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the slag heap, you name it,” he says.
I roll my eyes. “So when did I become so special? When they carted me off to the Capitol?”
“No. About six months before that. Right after New Year’s. We were in the Hob, eating some slop of Greasy Sae’s. And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit for one of his kisses. And I realized…I minded,” he tells me.
I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the afternoon. We’d been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae’s soup, made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we’d shot a week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting cross-legged on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his lips. “See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and ask her. If you need a reference.”
A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this happened. “Darius was just joking around,” I say.
“Probably. Although you’d be the last to figure out if he wasn’t,” Gale tells me. “Take Peeta. Take me. Or even Finnick. I was starting to worry he had his eye on you, but he seems back on track now.”
“You don’t know Finnick if you think he’d love me,” I say.
Gale shrugs. “I know he was desperate. That makes people do all kinds of crazy"

But it’s only when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize I’m in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for the Quarter Quell.

Early on, he seemed to accept Lyme’s assertion that the entrances couldn’t be taken, and dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or so, he’s sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration, staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence that follows Lyme’s ultimatum, he speaks up. “Is it really so necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to disable it?”
“That would be a step in the right direction,” says Beetee. “What do you have in mind?”
“Think of it as a wild dog den,” Gale continues. “You’re not going to fight your way in. So you have two choices. Trap the dogs inside or flush them out.”
“We’ve tried bombing the entrances,” says Lyme. “They’re set too far inside the stone for any real damage to be done.”
“I wasn’t thinking of that,” says Gale. “I was thinking of using the mountain.” Beetee rises and joins Gale at the window, peering through his ill-fitting glasses. “See? Running down the sides?”
“Avalanche paths,” says Beetee under his breath. “It’d be tricky. We’d have to design the detonation sequence with great care, and once it’s in motion, we couldn’t hope to control it.”
“We don’t need to control it if we give up the idea that we have to possess the Nut,” says Gale. “Only shut it down.”
“So you’re suggesting we start avalanches and block the entrances?” asks Lyme.
“That’s it,” says Gale. “Trap the enemy inside, cut off from supplies. Make it impossible for them to send out their hovercraft.”
While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns. “You risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilation system. It’s rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in Thirteen. It depends entirely on pumping in air from the mountainsides. Block those vents and you’ll suffocate whoever is trapped.”
“They could still escape through the train tunnel to the square,” says Beetee.
“Not if we blow it up,” says Gale brusquely. His intent, his full intent, becomes clear. Gale has no interest in preserving the lives of those in the Nut. No interest in caging the prey for later use.
This is one of his death traps."

“The majority of the workers are citizens from Two,” says Beetee neutrally.
“So what?” says Gale. “We’ll never be able to trust them again.”
“They should at least have a chance to surrender,” says Lyme.
“Well, that’s a luxury we weren’t given when they fire-bombed Twelve, but you’re all so much cozier with the Capitol here,” says Gale. By the look on Lyme’s face, I think she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She’d probably have the upper hand, too, with all her training. But her anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells, “We watched children burn to death and there was nothing we could do!”
I have to close my eyes a minute, as the image rips through me. It has the desired effect. I want everyone in that mountain dead. Am about to say so. But then…I’m also a girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can’t help it. I can’t condemn someone to the death he’s suggesting. “Gale,” I say, taking his arm and trying to speak in a reasonable tone. “The Nut’s an old mine. It’d be like causing a massive coal mining accident.” Surely the words are enough to make anyone from 12 think twice about the plan.
“But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers,” he retorts. “Is that everyone’s problem? That our enemies might have a few hours to reflect on the fact that they’re dying, instead of just being blown to bits?”
Back in the old days, when we were nothing more than a couple of kids hunting outside of 12, Gale said things like this and worse. But then they were just words. Here, put into practice, they become deeds that can never be reversed.
“You don’t know how those District Two people ended up in the Nut,” I say. “They may have been coerced. They may be held against their will. Some are our own spies. Will you kill them, too?”
“I would sacrifice a few, yes, to take out the rest of them,” he replies. “And if I were a spy in there, I’d say, ‘Bring on the avalanches!’”
I know he’s telling the truth. That Gale would sacrifice his life in this way for the cause—no one doubts it. Perhaps we’d all do the same if we were the spies and given the choice. I guess I would. But it’s a coldhearted decision to make for other people and those who love them.
“You said we had two choices,” Boggs tells him. “To trap them or to flush them out. I say we try to avalanche the mountain but leave the train tunnel alone. People can escape into the square, where we’ll be waiting for them.”
“Heavily armed, I hope,” says Gale. “You can be sure they’ll be.”
“Heavily armed. We’ll take them prisoner,” agrees Boggs.
“Let’s bring Thirteen into the loop now,” Beetee suggests. “Let President Coin weigh in.”
“She’ll want to block the tunnel,” says Gale with conviction.
“Yes, most likely. But you know, Peeta did have a point in his propos. About the dangers of killing ourselves off. I’ve been playing with some numbers. Factoring in the casualties and the wounded and…I think it’s at least worth a conversation,” says Beetee.
Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that conversation. Gale and I are released with the rest. I take him hunting so he can blow off some steam, but he’s not talking about it. Probably too angry with me for countering him.
The call does happen, a decision is made, and by evening I’m suited up in my Mockingjay outfit, with my bow slung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects me to Haymitch in 13—just in case a good opportunity for a propo arises. We wait on the roof of the Justice Building with a clear view of our target.
Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the commanders in the Nut, because in the past they’ve been little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot. But after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the mountain, the planes have their attention. By the time the Capitol’s antiaircraft weapons begin to fire, it’s already too late.
Gale’s plan exceeds anyone’s expectations. Beetee was right about being unable to control the avalanches once they’d been set in motion. The mountainsides are naturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they seem almost fluid. Whole sections of the Nut collapse before our eyes, obliterating any sign that human beings have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny and insignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the mountain. Burying the entrances under tons of rock. Raising a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky. Turning the Nut into a tomb.
I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing. Lights flickering into darkness. Stone dust choking the air. The shrieks of panicked, trapped beings stumbling madly for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, the ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock trying to force its way in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking out, rubble making a familiar path a maze. People slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses in, threatening to crush their fragile shells.

On the day my father died, the sirens went off during my school lunch. No one waited for dismissal, or was expected to. The response to a mine accident was something outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to Prim’s class. I still remember her, tiny at seven, very pale, but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk. Waiting for me to collect her as I’d promised I would if the sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed my coat sleeve, and we wove through the streams of people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In retrospect, I guess I should have known there was a problem right then. Because why were we looking for her, when the reverse should have been true?
The elevators were screeching, burning up and down their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into the light of day. With each group came cries of relief, relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands, wives, children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing air as the afternoon turned overcast, a light snow dusted the earth. The elevators moved more slowly now and disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed my hands into the cinders, wanting so badly to pull my father free. If there’s a more helpless feeling than trying to reach someone you love who’s trapped underground, I don’t know it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the night. Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers. A mug of something hot that you don’t drink. And then finally, at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the mine captain that could only mean one thing.

What did we just do?

He says he recognized the song.”
For a moment, my heart skips a beat. Then I realize it’s just more tracker jacker serum confusion. “He couldn’t, Haymitch. He never heard me sing that song.”
“Not you. Your father. He heard him singing it one day when he came to trade at the bakery. Peeta was small, probably six or seven, but he remembered it because he was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing,” says Haymitch. “Guess they did.”
Six or seven. That would have been before my mother banned the song. Maybe even right around the time I was learning it. “Was I there, too?”
“Don’t think so. No mention of you anyway. But it’s the first connection to you that hasn’t triggered some mental meltdown,” says Haymitch. “It’s something, at least, Katniss.”
My father. He seems to be everywhere today. Dying in the mine. Singing his way into Peeta’s muddled consciousness. Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as he protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders. I miss him so badly it hurts.

The pair of trains comes screeching into the train station side by side. As the doors slide open, people tumble out in a cloud of smoke they’ve brought from the Nut. They must have had at least an inkling of what would await them at the square, because you can see them trying to act evasively. Most of them flatten on the floor, and a spray of bullets inside the station takes out the lights. They’ve come armed, as Gale predicted, but they’ve come wounded as well. The moans can be heard in the otherwise silent night air.
Someone kills the lights on the stairs, leaving me in the protection of shadow. A flame blooms inside the station—one of the trains must actually be on fire—and a thick, black smoke billows against the windows. Left with no choice, the people begin to push out into the square, choking but defiantly waving their guns. My eyes dart around the rooftops that ring the square. Every one of them has been fortified with rebel-manned machine gun nests. Moonlight glints off oiled barrels.
A young man staggers out from the station, one hand pressed against a bloody cloth at his cheek, the other dragging a gun. When he trips and falls to his face, I see the scorch marks down the back of his shirt, the red flesh beneath. And suddenly, he’s just another burn victim from a mine accident.
My feet fly down the steps and I take off running for him. “Stop!” I yell at the rebels. “Hold your fire!” The words echo around the square and beyond as the mike amplifies my voice. “Stop!” I’m nearing the young man, reaching down to help him, when he drags himself up to his knees and trains his gun on my head.
I instinctively back up a few steps, raise my bow over my head to show my intention was harmless. Now that he has both hands on his gun, I notice the ragged hole in his cheek where something—falling stone maybe—punctured the flesh. He smells of burning things, hair and meat and fuel. His eyes are crazed with pain and fear.

“Freeze,” Haymitch’s voice whispers in my ear. I follow his order, realizing that this is what all of District 2, all of Panem maybe, must be seeing at the moment. The Mockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to lose.
His garbled speech is barely comprehensible. “Give me one reason I shouldn’t shoot you.”
The rest of the world recedes. There’s only me looking into the wretched eyes of the man from the Nut who asks for one reason. Surely I should be able to come up with thousands. But the words that make it to my lips are “I can’t.”
Logically, the next thing that should happen is the man pulling the trigger. But he’s perplexed, trying to make sense of my words. I experience my own confusion as I realize what I’ve said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that carried me across the square is replaced by despair. “I can’t. That’s the problem, isn’t it?” I lower my bow. “We blew up your mine. You burned my district to the ground. We’ve got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the Capitol happy. I’m done killing their slaves for them.” I drop my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot. It slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees.
“I’m not their slave,” the man mutters.
“I am,” I say. “That’s why I killed Cato…and he killed Thresh…and he killed Clove…and she tried to kill me. It just goes around and around, and who wins? Not us. Not the districts. Always the Capitol. But I’m tired of being a piece in their Games.”
Peeta. On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger Games. He understood it all before we’d even set foot in the arena. I hope he’s watching now, that he remembers that night as it happened, and maybe forgives me when I die.
“Keep talking. Tell them about watching the mountain go down,” Haymitch insists.
“When I saw that mountain fall tonight, I thought…they’ve done it again. Got me to kill you—the people in the districts. But why did I do it? District Twelve and District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol gave us.” The young man blinks at me uncomprehendingly. I sink on my knees before him, my voice low and urgent. “And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops? With Lyme, who was your victor? With people who were your neighbors, maybe even your family?”
“I don’t know,” says the man. But he doesn’t take his gun off me.
I rise and turn slowly in a circle, addressing the machine guns. “And you up there? I come from a mining town. Since when do miners condemn other miners to that kind of death, and then stand by to kill whoever manages to crawl from the rubble?”
“Who is the enemy?” whispers Haymitch.
“These people”—I indicate the wounded bodies on the square—“are not your enemy!” I whip back around to the train station. “The rebels are not your enemy! We all have one enemy, and it’s the Capitol! This is our chance to put an end to their power, but we need every district person to do it!”

The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands to the man, to the wounded, to the reluctant rebels across Panem. “Please! Join us!”
My words hang in the air. I look to the screen, hoping to see them recording some wave of reconciliation going through the crowd.
Instead I watch myself get shot on television."

In the twilight of morphling, Peeta whispers the word and I go searching for him. It’s a gauzy, violet-tinted world, with no hard edges, and many places to hide. I push through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.
When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep syrup. My heel had been injured after I’d climbed out on a branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12. Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I couldn’t quite catch. But some part of my brain had trapped his single word of reply and let it swim up through my dreams to taunt me now. “Always.”"

At first I feel threatened, because she attacked me in the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save my life. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn’t mean she doesn’t despise me. Maybe her treatment of me was all an act for the Capitol?
“I’m alive,” I say rustily.
“No kidding, brainless.” Johanna walks over and plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know we’re not in for some warm reunion scene. “Still a little sore?” With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped into the crook of her own. “They started cutting back my supply a few days ago. Afraid I’m going to turn into one of those freaks from Six. I’ve had to borrow from you when the coast was clear. Didn’t think you’d mind.”
Mind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured to death by Snow after the Quarter Quell? I have no right to mind, and she knows it.
Johanna sighs as the morphling enters her bloodstream. “Maybe they were onto something in Six. Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such a bad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway.”
In the weeks since I left 13, she’s gained some weight back. A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved head, helping to hide some of the scars. But if she’s siphoning off my morphling, she’s struggling.
“They’ve got this head doctor who comes around every day. Supposed to be helping me recover. Like some guy who’s spent his life in this rabbit warren’s going to fix me up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he reminds me that I’m totally safe.” I manage a smile. It’s a truly stupid thing to say, especially to a victor. As if such a state of being ever existed, anywhere, for anyone. “How about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?”
“Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot,” I say.
“Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna saw to that,” she says.
I think of the layers of protective armor in my Mockingjay outfit. But the pain came from somewhere. “Broken ribs?”
“Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured your spleen. They couldn’t repair it.” She gives a dismissive wave of her hand. “Don’t worry, you don’t need one. And if you did, they’d find you one, wouldn’t they? It’s everybody’s job to keep you alive.”
“Is that why you hate me?” I ask.
“Partly,” she admits. “Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you’re a little hard to swallow. With your tacky romantic drama and your defender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn’t an act, which makes you more unbearable. Please feel free to take this personally.”
“You should have been the Mockingjay. No one would’ve had to feed you lines,” I say.
“True. But no one likes me,” she tells me.
“They trusted you, though. To get me out,” I remind her. “And they’re afraid of you.”
“Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you’re the one they’re scared of now.” Gale"

She scoots off my bed and crosses to the door, nudging Gale’s leg with her hip as she passes him. “Are you, gorgeous?” We can hear her laughter as she disappears down the hall.
I raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my hand. “Terrified,” he mouths. I laugh, but it turns into a wince. “Easy.” He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. “You’ve got to stop running straight into trouble.”
“I know. But someone blew up a mountain,” I answer.
Instead of pulling back, he leans in closer, searching my face. “You think I’m heartless.”
“I know you’re not. But I won’t tell you it’s okay,” I say.
Now he draws back, almost impatiently. “Katniss, what difference is there, really, between crushing our enemy in a mine or blowing them out of the sky with one of Beetee’s arrows? The result is the same.”
“I don’t know. We were under attack in Eight, for one thing. The hospital was under attack,” I say.

“Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,” he says. “So, by taking them out, we prevented further attacks.”
“But that kind of thinking…you could turn it into an argument for killing anyone at any time. You could justify sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districts from getting out of line,” I say.
“I don’t buy that,” he tells me.
“I do,” I reply. “It must be those trips to the arena.”
“Fine. We know how to disagree,” he says. “We always have. Maybe it’s good. Between you and me, we’ve got District Two now.”
“Really?” For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up inside me. Then I think about the people on the square. “Was there fighting after I was shot?”
“Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the Capitol soldiers. The rebels just sat by and watched,” he says. “Actually, the whole country just sat by and watched.”
“Well, that’s what they do best,” I say."

Now that District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather from the war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to the wounded, reorganizing their troops. The Capitol, like 13 during the Dark Days, finds itself completely cut off from outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over its enemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to reinvent itself and become self-sufficient.
“Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,” says Plutarch. “Certainly, there are emergency supplies stockpiled. But the significant difference between Thirteen and the Capitol are the expectations of the populace. Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all they’ve known is Panem et Circenses.”
“What’s that?” I recognize Panem, of course, but the rest is nonsense.
“It’s a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a language called Latin about a place called Rome,” he explains. “Panem et Circenses translates into ‘Bread and Circuses.’ The writer was saying that in return for full bellies and entertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities and therefore their power.”
I think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the ultimate entertainment. The Hunger Games. “So that’s what the districts are for. To provide the bread and circuses.”
“Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol could control its little empire. Right now, it can provide neither, at least at the standard the people are accustomed to,” says Plutarch. “We have the food and I’m about to orchestrate an entertainment propo that’s sure to be popular. After all, everybody loves a wedding.”
I freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he’s suggesting. Somehow staging some perverse wedding between Peeta and me. I haven’t been able to face that one-way glass since I’ve been back and, at my own request, only get updates about Peeta’s condition from Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Different techniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way to cure him. And now they want me to marry Peeta for a propo?
Plutarch rushes to reassure me. “Oh, no, Katniss. Not your wedding. Finnick and Annie’s. All you need to do is show up and pretend to be happy for them.”
“That’s one of the few things I won’t have to pretend, Plutarch,” I tell him."
highlight,Mockingjay,Suzanne Collins,2023-12-18T09:23:24.298,2023-12-18T09:25:18Z,,"The next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event is planned. The differences between the Capitol and 13 are thrown into sharp relief by the event. When Coin says “wedding,” she means two people signing a piece of paper and being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means hundreds of people dressed in finery at a three-day celebration. It’s amusing to watch them haggle over the details. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical note. After Coin vetoes a dinner, entertainment, and alcohol, Plutarch yells, “What’s the point of the propo if no one’s having any fun!”
It’s hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a quiet celebration causes a stir in 13, where they seem to have no holidays at all. When it’s announced that children are wanted to sing District 4’s wedding song, practically every kid shows up. There’s no shortage of volunteers to help make decorations. In the dining hall, people chat excitedly about the event.
Maybe it’s more than the festivities. Maybe it’s that we are all so starved for something good to happen that we want to be part of it. It would explain why—when Plutarch has a fit over what the bride will wear—I volunteer to take Annie back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory Tour. I’m a little leery about being with Annie since all I really know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody thinks she’s mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she’s less mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air. Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right, she’s strange, but if Finnick loves her, that’s good enough for me.
I got permission for my prep team to come along, so I’m relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna’s presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against her cheek, and bursts into tears. “It’s been so long,” she gasps, “since I’ve seen anything pretty.”
Despite reservations on Coin’s side that it’s too extravagant, and on Plutarch’s side that it’s too drab, the wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument. So it’s simple, frugal by the Capitol’s standards. It doesn’t matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the couple. It isn’t about their borrowed finery—Annie wears a green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta’s suits that they altered—although the clothes are striking. Who can look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from 10, conducts the ceremony, since it’s similar to the one used in his district. But there are unique touches of District 4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple during their vows, the touching of each other’s lips with salt water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens marriage to a sea voyage.
No, I don’t have to pretend to be happy for them.
After the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a toast with apple cider, the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns every head from 12. We may have been the smallest, poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance. Nothing has been officially scheduled at this point, but Plutarch, who’s calling the propo from the control room, must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Sae grabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the floor and faces off with him. People pour in to join them, forming two long lines. And the dancing begins.
I’m standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm, when a bony hand pinches me above the elbow. Johanna scowls at me. “Are you going to miss the chance to let Snow see you dancing?” She’s right. What could spell victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave us a lot of time to practice, we’re actually pretty good partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we take our places in the line. It hurts, but the satisfaction of having Snow watch me dance with my little sister reduces other feelings to dust.
Dancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the District 13 guests. Insist on a special number for the bride and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinning circle where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or fun has happened in so long. This could go on all night if not for the last event planned in Plutarch’s propo. One I hadn’t heard about, but then it was meant to be a surprise."

Most of the guests back up, making way for this rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green, white-tipped icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and sea flowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm what I knew at first sight. As surely as the embroidery stitches in Annie’s gown were done by Cinna’s hand, the frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta’s.
This may seem like a small thing, but it speaks volumes. Haymitch has been keeping a great deal from me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, trying to tear free of his restraints, could never have made this. Never have had the focus, kept his hands steady, designed something so perfect for Finnick and Annie. As if anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side."

Out in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, “What’s happening to him?”
Haymitch shakes his head. “I don’t know. None of us knows. Sometimes he’s almost rational, and then, for no reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kind of therapy. He’s been working on it for days. Watching him…he seemed almost like before.”
“So, he’s got the run of the place?” I ask. The idea makes me nervous on about five different levels.
“Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He’s still under lock and key. But I’ve talked to him,” Haymitch says.
“Face-to-face?” I ask. “And he didn’t go nuts?”
“No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons. Not telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot.” Haymitch pauses a moment, as if deciding something. “He says he’d like to see you.”
I’m on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green waves, the deck shifting beneath my feet. My palms press into the wall to steady myself. This wasn’t part of the plan. I wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill Snow, and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a temporary setback. Never was I supposed to hear the words He says he’d like to see you.

Haymitch doesn’t protest when I walk out. Down the hall. Through the beehive of compartments. Find a warm pipe to hide behind in a laundry room. It takes a long time before I get to the bottom of why I’m so upset. When I do, it’s almost too mortifying to admit. All those months of taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent. Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.

And now I’m paying for my negligence.
Back in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same circumstance and spitting mad. I tell her about what Coin said. “Maybe you can train, too.”
“Fine. I’ll train. But I’m going to the stinking Capitol if I have to kill a crew and fly there myself,” says Johanna.
“Probably best not to bring that up in training,” I say. “But it’s nice to know I’ll have a ride.”

“Well, I’ll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to take at least another month to heal up on their own,” she says.
I shake my head. “I don’t have a month.”
She looks me up and down. “The doctors haven’t offered you any treatment?”
“Is there a treatment?” I ask. “They said they had to mend naturally.”
“That’s what they say. But they could speed up the process if I recommend it. I warn you, though, it isn’t any fun,” she tells me.
“Please. I’ve got to get to the Capitol,” I say.
Soldier York doesn’t question this. She scribbles something on a pad and sends me directly back to the hospital. I hesitate. I don’t want to miss any more training. “I’ll be back for the afternoon session,” I promise. She just purses her lips.
Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I’m flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It’s been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven’t used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna’s sake. Today they tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller, as the mixture of the two drugs—the morphling and whatever’s set my ribs on fire—has dangerous side effects. They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days. But I told them to go ahead.

I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest burning, and Johanna’s fighting off withdrawal symptoms. Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway. But by three in the morning, I’m the target of every colorful bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags me out of bed, determined to get to training.
“I don’t think I can do it,” I confess.
“You can do it. We both can. We’re victors, remember? We’re the ones who can survive anything they throw at us,” she snarls at me. She’s a sick greenish color, shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.
We must be victors to make it through the morning. I think I’m going to lose Johanna when we realize it’s pouring outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have ceased breathing.
“It’s just water. It won’t kill us,” I say. She clenches her jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew. Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I manage it, but Johanna can’t hold her hands steady enough to fit the parts together. When York’s back is turned, I help her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon’s an improvement because we’re on the shooting range. At last, something I’m good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow to a gun, but by the end of the day, I’ve got the best score in my class.
We’re just inside the hospital doors when Johanna declares, “This has to stop. Us living in the hospital. Everyone views us as patients.”
It’s not a problem for me. I can move into our family compartment, but Johanna’s never been assigned one. When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they won’t agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put two and two together about the morphling and this only adds to their view that she’s unstable. “She won’t be alone. I’m going to room with her,” I announce. There’s some dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who agrees to keep an eye on us.
After I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes herself down with a damp cloth, she makes a cursory inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer that holds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. “Sorry.”
I think how there’s nothing in Johanna’s drawer but her government-issued clothes. That she doesn’t have one thing in the world to call her own. “It’s okay. You can look at my stuff if you want.”

“Maybe. But he’s changed,” I say.

“No,” I answer.
“That’s the one thing I think my head doctor might be right about. There’s no going back. So we might as well get on with things.” She neatly returns my keepsakes to the drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as the lights go out. “You’re not afraid I’ll kill you tonight?”
“Like I couldn’t take you,” I answer. Then we laugh, since both our bodies are so wrecked, it will be a miracle if we can get up the next day. But we do. Each morning, we do. And by the end of the week, my ribs feel almost like new, and Johanna can assemble her rifle without help."

The life has gone out of our little party. Finnick murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her hands. Then there’s a long silence while people pretend to eat."

Annie cautiously looks across Johanna. “Thank you, Peeta. It was beautiful.”
“My pleasure, Annie,” says Peeta, and I hear that old note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone forever. Not that it’s directed at me. But still.
“If we’re going to fit in that walk, we better go,” Finnick tells her. He arranges both of their trays so he can carry them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other. “Good seeing you, Peeta.”
“You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her away from you.” It could be a joke, if the tone wasn’t so cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. The open distrust of Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie, that Annie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.
“Oh, Peeta,” says Finnick lightly. “Don’t make me sorry I restarted your heart.” He leads Annie away after giving me a concerned glance.
When they’re gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice, “He did save your life, Peeta. More than once.”
“For her.” He gives me a brief nod. “For the rebellion. Not for me. I don’t owe him anything.”

I shouldn’t rise to the bait, but I do. “Maybe not. But Mags is dead and you’re still here. That should count for something.”
“Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that don’t seem to, Katniss. I’ve got some memories I can’t make sense of, and I don’t think the Capitol touched them. A lot of nights on the train, for instance,” he says.
Again the implications. That more happened on the train than did. That what did happen—those nights I only kept my sanity because his arms were around me—no longer matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of misusing him.
Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon, connecting Gale and me. “So, are you two officially a couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossed lover thing?”
“Still dragging,” says Johanna."

“What’s that?” asks Peeta.
“You,” Gale answers.
“You’ll have to be a little more specific,” says Peeta. “What about me?”

We reach my door. “Maybe he just sees me as I really am. I have to get some sleep.”

We spend a couple of hours quizzing each other on military terms. I visit my mother and Prim for a while. When I’m back in my compartment, showered, staring into the darkness, I finally ask, “Johanna, could you really hear him screaming?”

After lunch, I see him across the field, drilling with a group of beginners. I don’t know what they’re thinking. If a spat with Delly can reduce him to arguing with himself, he’s got no business learning how to assemble a gun.

There’s a nagging feeling that if it’s too simple, I must be missing the point. I’m within a couple of buildings from my goal when things begin to heat up. A half dozen Peacekeepers come charging around the corner. They will outgun me, but I notice something. A drum of gasoline lying carelessly in the gutter. This is it. My test. To perceive that blowing up the drum will be the only way to achieve my mission. Just as I step out to do it, my squadron leader, who’s been fairly useless up to this point, quietly orders me to hit the ground. Every instinct I have screams for me to ignore the voice, to pull the trigger, to blow the Peacekeepers sky-high. And suddenly, I realize what the military will think my biggest weakness is. From my first moment in the Games, when I ran for that orange backpack, to the firefight in 8, to my impulsive race across the square in 2. I cannot take orders.
I smack into the ground so hard and fast, I’ll be picking gravel out of my chin for a week. Someone else blows the gas tank. The Peacekeepers die. I make my rendezvous point. When I exit the Block on the far side, a soldier congratulates me, stamps my hand with squad number 451, and tells me to report to Command. Almost giddy with success, I run through the halls, skidding around corners, bounding down the steps because the elevator’s too slow. I bang into the room before the oddity of the situation dawns on me. I shouldn’t be in Command; I should be getting my hair buzzed. The people around the table aren’t freshly minted soldiers but the ones calling the shots.
Boggs smiles and shakes his head when he sees me. “Let’s see it.” Unsure now, I hold out my stamped hand. “You’re with me. It’s a special unit of sharpshooters. Join your squad.” He nods over at a group lining the wall. Gale. Finnick. Five others I don’t know. My squad. I’m not only in, I get to work under Boggs. With my friends. I force myself to take calm, soldierly steps to join them, instead of jumping up and down."

He’s explaining something about the nature of what we will encounter in the Capitol. I’m thinking this is a terrible presentation—because even on tiptoe I can’t see what’s on the panel—until he hits a button. A holographic image of a block of the Capitol projects into the air.
“This, for example, is the area surrounding one of the Peacekeepers’ barracks. Not unimportant, but not the most crucial of targets, and yet look.” Plutarch enters some sort of code on a keyboard, and lights begin to flash. They’re in an assortment of colors and blink at different speeds. “Each light is called a pod. It represents a different obstacle, the nature of which could be anything from a bomb to a band of mutts. Make no mistake, whatever it contains is designed to either trap or kill you. Some have been in place since the Dark Days, others developed over the years. To be honest, I created a fair number myself. This program, which one of our people absconded with when we left the Capitol, is our most recent information. They don’t know we have it. But even so, it’s likely that new pods have been activated in the last few months. This is what you will face.”
I’m unaware that my feet are moving to the table until I’m inches from the holograph. My hand reaches in and cups a rapidly blinking green light.
Someone joins me, his body tense. Finnick, of course. Because only a victor would see what I see so immediately. The arena. Laced with pods controlled by Gamemakers. Finnick’s fingers caress a steady red glow over a doorway. “Ladies and gentlemen…”
His voice is quiet, but mine rings through the room. “Let the Seventy-sixth Hunger Games begin!”
I laugh. Quickly. Before anyone has time to register what lies beneath the words I have just uttered. Before eyebrows are raised, objections are uttered, two and two are put together, and the solution is that I should be kept as far away from the Capitol as possible. Because an angry, independently thinking victor with a layer of psychological scar tissue too thick to penetrate is maybe the last person you want on your squad.
“I don’t even know why you bothered to put Finnick and me through training, Plutarch,” I say.
“Yeah, we’re already the two best-equipped soldiers you have,” Finnick adds cockily.

“Do not think that fact escapes me,” he says with an impatient wave. “Now back in line, Soldiers Odair and Everdeen. I have a presentation to finish.”
We retreat to our places, ignoring the questioning looks thrown our way. I adopt an attitude of extreme concentration as Plutarch continues, nodding my head here and there, shifting my position to get a better view, all the while telling myself to hang on until I can get to the woods and scream. Or curse. Or cry. Or maybe all three at once.
If this was a test, Finnick and I both pass it."

When I tell him what I want to do, he writes me a pass so that I can go to the woods during Reflection, provided I stay within sight of the guards. I run to my compartment, thinking to use the parachute, but it’s so full of ugly memories. Instead, I go across the hall and take one of the white cotton bandages I brought from 12. Square. Sturdy. Just the thing.
In the woods, I find a pine tree and strip handfuls of fragrant needles from the boughs. After making a neat pile in the middle of the bandage, I gather up the sides, give them a twist, and tie them tightly with a length of vine, making an apple-sized bundle.
At the hospital room door, I watch Johanna for a moment, realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasive attitude. Stripped of that, as she is now, there’s only a slight young woman, her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awake against the power of the drugs. Terrified of what sleep will bring. I cross to her and hold out the bundle.
“What’s that?” she says hoarsely. Damp edges of her hair form little spikes over her forehead.
“I made it for you. Something to put in your drawer.” I place it in her hands. “Smell it.”
She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative sniff. “Smells like home.” Tears flood her eyes.
“That’s what I was hoping. You being from Seven and all,” I say. “Remember when we met? You were a tree. Well, briefly.”
Suddenly, she has my wrist in an iron grip. “You have to kill him, Katniss.”
“Don’t worry.” I resist the temptation to wrench my arm free.
“Swear it. On something you care about,” she hisses.
“I swear it. On my life.” But she doesn’t let go of my arm.
“On your family’s life,” she insists.
“On my family’s life,” I repeat. I guess my concern for my own survival isn’t compelling enough. She lets go and I rub my wrist. “Why do you think I’m going, anyway, brainless?”
That makes her smile a little. “I just needed to hear it.” She presses the bundle of pine needles to her nose and closes her eyes.

Along with Finnick and Gale, the squad includes five soldiers from 13. Jackson, a middle-aged woman who’s Boggs’s second in command, looks kind of sluggish but can hit things the rest of us can’t even see without a scope. Farsighted, she says. There’s a pair of sisters in their twenties named Leeg—we call them Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 for clarity—who are so similar in uniform, I can’t tell them apart until I notice Leeg 1 has weird yellow flecks in her eyes. Two older guys, Mitchell and Homes, never say much but can shoot the dust off your boots at fifty yards. I see other squads that are also quite good, but I don’t fully understand our status until the morning Plutarch joins us.
“Squad Four-Five-One, you have been selected for a special mission,” he begins. I bite the inside of my lip, hoping against hope that it’s to assassinate Snow. “We have numerous sharpshooters, but rather a dearth of camera crews. Therefore, we’ve handpicked the eight of you to be what we call our ‘Star Squad.’ You will be the on-screen faces of the invasion.”
Disappointment, shock, then anger run through the group. “What you’re saying is, we won’t be in actual combat,” snaps Gale.
“You will be in combat, but perhaps not always on the front line. If one can even isolate a front line in this type of war,” says Plutarch.
“None of us wants that.” Finnick’s remark is followed by a general rumble of assent, but I stay silent. “We’re going to fight.”
“You’re going to be as useful to the war effort as possible,” Plutarch says. “And it’s been decided that you are of most value on television. Just look at the effect Katniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit. Turned the whole rebellion around. Do you notice how she’s the only one not complaining? It’s because she understands the power of that screen.”
Actually, Katniss isn’t complaining because she has no intention of staying with the “Star Squad,” but she recognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitol before carrying out any plan. Still, to be too compliant may arouse suspicion as well.
“But it’s not all pretend, is it?” I ask. “That’d be a waste of talent.”

Most of the Capitol’s air fleet was destroyed in 2 or during the invasion. If it has any craft left, it’s holding on to them. Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make a last-minute escape to some presidential bunker somewhere if needed. Our own hoverplanes were grounded after the Capitol’s antiaircraft missiles decimated the first few waves. This war will be battled out on the streets with, hopefully, only superficial damage to the infrastructure and a minimum of human casualties.

So there’s a lot of time spent shattering things that don’t matter, to throw them off the scent. Mostly we just add to the piles of rainbow glass that’s been blown off the exteriors of the candy-colored buildings. I suspect they are intercutting this footage with the destruction of significant Capitol targets. Once in a while it seems a real sharpshooter’s services are needed. Eight hands go up, but Gale, Finnick, and I are never chosen.

I don’t think they quite know what to do with the three of us, particularly me. I have my Mockingjay outfit with me, but I’ve only been taped in my uniform. Sometimes I use a gun, sometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrows. It’s as if they don’t want to entirely lose the Mockingjay, but they want to downgrade my role to foot soldier.

Each of us has a paper map of the Capitol. The city forms an almost perfect square. Lines divide the map into smaller squares, with letters along the top and numbers down the side to form a grid. I consume this, noting every intersection and side street, but it’s remedial stuff. The commanders here are working off Plutarch’s holograph. Each has a handheld contraption called a Holo that produces images like I saw in Command. They can zoom into any area of the grid and see what pods await them. The Holo’s an independent unit, a glorified map really, since it can neither send nor receive signals. But it’s far superior to my paper version.
A Holo is activated by a specific commander’s voice giving his or her name. Once it’s working, it responds to the other voices in the squadron so if, say, Boggs were killed or severely disabled, someone could take over. If anyone in the squad repeats “nightlock” three times in a row, the Holo will explode, blowing everything in a five-yard radius sky-high. This is for security reasons in the event of capture. It’s understood that we would all do this without hesitation.
So what I need to do is steal Boggs’s activated Holo and clear out before he notices. I think it would be easier to steal his teeth."

“Why not?” I ask.
“I’m not sure you could really shoot Peeta, if it came to it,” she says.
I speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly. “I wouldn’t be shooting Peeta. He’s gone. Johanna’s right. It’d be just like shooting another of the Capitol’s mutts.” It feels good to say something horrible about him, out loud, in public, after all the humiliation I’ve felt since his return.

Some sleep under the open sky, close to the heater in the center of our camp, while others retreat to their tents.

Realizing with shame that my fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore a much more difficult problem. Trying to rescue Peeta from the shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in. I don’t know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can’t even conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded arena, locating Snow, and putting a bullet through his head look like child’s play.
At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn’t sleeping, though. Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest, clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope. I know it well. It’s the one Finnick lent me that night in the bunker.

That seems grossly unfair, and my first impulse is to say something cutting. But I revisit my conversation with Haymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peeta’s direction. “I never wanted to kill you. Except when I thought you were helping the Careers kill me. After that, I always thought of you as…an ally.” That’s a good safe word. Empty of any emotional obligation, but nonthreatening.
“Ally.” Peeta says the word slowly, tasting it. “Friend. Lover. Victor. Enemy. Fiancée. Target. Mutt. Neighbor. Hunter. Tribute. Ally. I’ll add it to the list of words I use to try to figure you out.” He weaves the rope in and out of his fingers. “The problem is, I can’t tell what’s real anymore, and what’s made up.”
The cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests that either people have woken or have never really been asleep at all. I suspect the latter.

“That’s right.” Then I think of something to add. “And yours is orange.”
“Orange?” He seems unconvinced.

“Oh.” He closes his eyes briefly, maybe trying to conjure up that sunset, then nods his head. “Thank you.”
But more words tumble out. “You’re a painter. You’re a baker. You like to sleep with the windows open. You never take sugar in your tea. And you always double-knot your shoelaces.”

He mentions something he thinks happened, and they tell him if it’s true or imagined, usually followed by a brief explanation.
“Most of the people from Twelve were killed in the fire.”
“Real. Less than nine hundred of you made it to Thirteen alive.”
“The fire was my fault.”
“Not real. President Snow destroyed Twelve the way he did Thirteen, to send a message to the rebels.”

This way Peeta will always have access to someone who knows him more personally. It’s not a steady conversation. Peeta spends a long time considering even small pieces of information, like where people bought their soap back home. Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about 12; Finnick is the expert on both of Peeta’s Games, as he was a mentor in the first and a tribute in the second. But since Peeta’s greatest confusion centers around me—and not everything can be explained simply—our exchanges are painful and loaded, even though we touch on only the most superficial of details. The color of my dress in 7. My preference for cheese buns. The name of our math teacher when we were little. Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciating. Perhaps it isn’t even possible after what Snow did to him. But it does feel right to help him try.

Peeta just shrugs. “I’m not much of a shot anyway.” He seems preoccupied with watching Pollux, to the point where it’s getting a little worrisome, when he finally puzzles it out and begins to speak with agitation. “You’re an Avox, aren’t you? I can tell by the way you swallow. There were two Avoxes with me in prison. Darius and Lavinia, but the guards mostly called them the redheads. They’d been our servants in the Training Center, so they arrested them, too. I watched them being tortured to death. She was lucky. They used too much voltage and her heart stopped right off. It took days to finish him off. Beating, cutting off parts. They kept asking him questions, but he couldn’t speak, he just made these horrible animal sounds. They didn’t want information, you know? They wanted me to see it.”
Peeta looks around at our stunned faces, as if waiting for a reply. When none is forthcoming, he asks, “Real or not real?” The lack of response upsets him more. “Real or not real?!” he demands.
“Real,” says Boggs. “At least, to the best of my knowledge…real.”
Peeta sags. “I thought so. There was nothing…shiny about it.” He wanders away from the group, muttering something about fingers and toes.
I move to Gale, press my forehead into the body armor where his chest should be, feel his arm tighten around me. We finally know the name of the girl who we watched the Capitol abduct from the woods of 12, the fate of the Peacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive. This is no time to call up happy moments of remembrance. They lost their lives because of me. I add them to my personal list of kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands. When I look up, I see it has taken Gale differently. His expression says that there are not enough mountains to crush, enough cities to destroy. It promises death."

He’s typing in a command, pressing his thumb to the screen for print recognition, speaking a string of letters and numbers in response to a prompt. A green shaft of light bursts out of the Holo and illuminates his face. He says, “Unfit for command. Transfer of prime security clearance to Squad Four-Five-One Soldier Katniss Everdeen.” It’s all he can do to turn the Holo toward my face. “Say your name.”

“Our radio communicators went dead almost immediately. Probably an electromagnetic pulse device. But I’ll get us back to camp. Give me the Holo.” Jackson reaches for the unit, but I clutch it to my chest.
“No. Boggs gave it to me,” I say.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snaps. Of course, she thinks it’s hers. She’s second in command.
“It’s true,” says Homes. “He transferred the prime security clearance to her while he was dying. I saw it.”
“Why would he do that?” demands Jackson.
Why indeed? My head’s reeling from the ghastly events of the last five minutes—Boggs mutilated, dying, dead, Peeta’s homicidal rage, Mitchell bloody and netted and swallowed by that foul black wave. I turn to Boggs, very badly needing him alive. Suddenly sure that he, and maybe he alone, is completely on my side. I think of his last orders….
“Don’t trust them. Don’t go back. Kill Peeta. Do what you came to do.”

What did he mean? Don’t trust who? The rebels? Coin? The people looking at me right now? I won’t go back, but he must know I can’t just fire a bullet through Peeta’s head. Can I? Should I? Did Boggs guess that what I really came to do is desert and kill Snow on my own?
I can’t work all of this out now, so I just decide to carry out the first two orders: to not trust anyone and to move deeper into the Capitol. But how can I justify this? Make them let me keep the Holo?
“Because I’m on a special mission for President Coin. I think Boggs was the only one who knew about it.”
This in no way convinces Jackson. “To do what?”
Why not tell them the truth? It’s as plausible as anything I’ll come up with. But it must seem like a real mission, not revenge. “To assassinate President Snow before the loss of life from this war makes our population unsustainable.”
“I don’t believe you,” says Jackson. “As your current commander, I order you to transfer the prime security clearance over to me.”
“No,” I say. “That would be in direct violation of President Coin’s orders.”
Guns are pointed. Half the squad at Jackson, half at me. Someone’s about to die, when Cressida speaks up. “It’s true. That’s why we’re here. Plutarch wants it televised. He thinks if we can film the Mockingjay assassinating Snow, it will end the war.”
This gives even Jackson pause. Then she gestures with her gun toward the closet. “And why is he here?”

There she has me. I can think of no sane reason that Coin would send an unstable boy, programmed to kill me, along on such a key assignment. It really weakens my story. Cressida comes to my aid again. “Because the two post-Games interviews with Caesar Flickerman were shot in President Snow’s personal quarters. Plutarch thinks Peeta may be of some use as a guide in a location we have little knowledge of.”
I want to ask Cressida why she’s lying for me, why she’s fighting for us to go on with my self-appointed mission. Now’s not the time.

And those are only the pods Plutarch knows about. The Holo didn’t indicate that the block we just left was mined, had the black geyser, or that the net was made from barbed wire. Besides that, there may be Peacekeepers to deal with, now that they know our position. I bite the inside of my lip, feeling everyone’s eyes on me. “Put on your masks. We’re going out the way we came in.”
Instant objections. I raise my voice over them. “If the wave was that powerful, then it may have triggered and absorbed other pods in our path.”
People stop to consider this. Pollux makes a few quick signs to his brother. “It may have disabled the cameras as well,” Castor translates. “Coated the lenses.”
Gale props one of his boots on the counter and examines the splatter of black on the toe. Scrapes it with a kitchen knife from a block on the counter. “It’s not corrosive. I think it was meant to either suffocate or poison us.”

“If anyone needs to go back, for whatever reason, now is the time,” I say. “No questions asked, no hard feelings.” No one seems inclined to retreat.

“It’s all right!” calls Cressida. “It’s just an emergency broadcast. Every Capitol television is automatically activated for it.”
There we are on-screen, just after the bomb took out Boggs. A voice-over tells the audience what they are viewing as we try to regroup, react to the black gel shooting from the street, lose control of the situation. We watch the chaos that follows until the wave blots out the cameras. The last thing we see is Gale, alone on the street, trying to shoot through the cables that hold Mitchell aloft.
The reporter identifies Gale, Finnick, Boggs, Peeta, Cressida, and me by name.
“There’s no aerial footage. Boggs must have been right about their hovercraft capacity,” says Castor. I didn’t notice this, but I guess it’s the kind of thing a cameraman picks up on.
Coverage continues from the courtyard behind the apartment where we took shelter. Peacekeepers line the roof across from our former hideout. Shells are launched into the row of apartments, setting off the chain of explosions we heard, and the building collapses into rubble and dust.
Now we cut to a live feed. A reporter stands on the roof with the Peacekeepers. Behind her, the apartment block burns. Firefighters try to control the blaze with water hoses. We are pronounced dead.
“Finally, a bit of luck,” says Homes.
I guess he’s right. Certainly it’s better than having the Capitol in pursuit of us. But I just keep imagining how this will be playing back in 13. Where my mother and Prim, Hazelle and the kids, Annie, Haymitch, and a whole lot of people from 13 think that they have just seen us die.
“My father. He just lost my sister and now…” says Leeg 1.
We watch as they play the footage over and over. Revel in their victory, especially over me. Break away to do a montage of the Mockingjay’s rise to rebel power—I think they’ve had this part prepared for a while, because it seems pretty polished—and then go live so a couple of reporters can discuss my well-deserved violent end. Later, they promise, Snow will make an official statement. The screen fades back to a glow.
The rebels made no attempt to break in during the broadcast, which leads me to believe they think it’s true. If that’s so, we really are on our own.
“So, now that we’re dead, what’s our next move?” asks Gale.
“Isn’t it obvious?” No one even knew Peeta had regained consciousness. I don’t know how long he’s been watching, but by the look of misery on his face, long enough to see what happened on the street. How he went mad, tried to bash my head in, and hurled Mitchell into the pod. He painfully pushes himself up to a sitting position and directs his words to Gale.
“Our next move…is to kill me.”"

“I just murdered a member of our squad!” shouts Peeta.
“You pushed him off you. You couldn’t have known he would trigger the net at that exact spot,” says Finnick, trying to calm him.
“Who cares? He’s dead, isn’t he?” Tears begin to run down Peeta’s face. “I didn’t know. I’ve never seen myself like that before. Katniss is right. I’m the monster. I’m the mutt. I’m the one Snow has turned into a weapon!”
“It’s not your fault, Peeta,” says Finnick.
“You can’t take me with you. It’s only a matter of time before I kill someone else.” Peeta looks around at our conflicted faces. “Maybe you think it’s kinder to just dump me somewhere. Let me take my chances. But that’s the same thing as handing me over to the Capitol. Do you think you’d be doing me a favor by sending me back to Snow?”
Peeta. Back in Snow’s hands. Tortured and tormented until no bits of his former self will ever emerge again.
For some reason, the last stanza to “The Hanging Tree” starts running through my head. The one where the man wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evil that awaits her in the world.

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

“I’ll kill you before that happens,” says Gale. “I promise.”
Peeta hesitates, as if considering the reliability of this offer, and then shakes his head. “It’s no good. What if you’re not there to do it? I want one of those poison pills like the rest of you have.”
Nightlock. There’s one pill back at camp, in its special slot on the sleeve of my Mockingjay suit. But there’s another in the breast pocket of my uniform. Interesting that they didn’t issue one to Peeta. Perhaps Coin thought he might take it before he had the opportunity to kill me. It’s unclear if Peeta means he’d finish himself off now, to spare us having to murder him, or only if the Capitol took him prisoner again. In the state he’s in, I expect it would be sooner rather than later. It would certainly make things easier on the rest of us. Not to have to shoot him. It would certainly simplify the problem of dealing with his homicidal episodes.
I don’t know if it’s the pods, or the fear, or watching Boggs die, but I feel the arena all around me. It’s as if I’ve never left, really. Once again I’m battling not only for my own survival but for Peeta’s as well. How satisfying, how entertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him. To have Peeta’s death on my conscience for whatever is left of my life.
“It’s not about you,” I say. “We’re on a mission. And you’re necessary to it.” I look to the rest of the group. “Think we might find some food here?”
Besides the medical kit and cameras, we have nothing but our uniforms and our weapons.
Half of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out for Snow’s broadcast, while the others hunt for something to eat. Messalla proves most valuable because he lived in a near replica of this apartment and knows where people would be most likely to stash food. Like how there’s a storage space concealed by a mirrored panel in the bedroom, or how easy it is to pop out the ventilation screen in the hallway. So even though the kitchen cupboards are bare, we find over thirty canned goods and several boxes of cookies.
The hoarding disgusts the soldiers raised in 13. “Isn’t this illegal?” says Leeg 1.
“On the contrary, in the Capitol you’d be considered stupid not to do it,” says Messalla. “Even before the Quarter Quell, people were starting to stock up on scarce supplies.”
“While others went without,” says Leeg 1.
“Right,” says Messalla. “That’s how it works here.”
“Fortunately, or we wouldn’t have dinner,” says Gale. “Everybody grab a can.”
Some of our company seem reluctant to do this, but it’s as good a method as any. I’m really not in the mood to divvy up everything into eleven equal parts, factoring in age, body weight, and physical output. I poke around in the pile, about to settle on some cod chowder, when Peeta holds out a can to me. “Here.”
I take it, not knowing what to expect. The label reads Lamb Stew.
I press my lips together at the memories of rain dripping through stones, my inept attempts at flirting, and the aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in the chilly air. So some part of it must still be in his head, too. How happy, how hungry, how close we were when that picnic basket arrived outside our cave. “Thanks.” I pop open the top. “It even has dried plums.” I bend the lid and use it as a makeshift spoon, scooping a bit into my mouth.

Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa. So I say, “Any ideas?”
“Why don’t we start by ruling out possibilities,” says Finnick. “The street is not a possibility.”
“The rooftops are just as bad as the street,” says Leeg 1.
“We still might have a chance to withdraw, go back the way we came,” says Homes. “But that would mean a failed mission.”

A pang of guilt hits me since I’ve fabricated said mission. “It was never intended for all of us to go forward. You just had the misfortune to be with me.”

Send the empty cans down a trash chute, pocket the full ones for later, flip sofa cushions smeared with blood, wipe traces of gel from the tiles. There’s no fixing the latch on the front door, but we lock a second bolt, which will at least keep the door from swinging open on contact.
Finally, there’s only Peeta to contend with. He plants himself on the blue sofa, refusing to budge. “I’m not going. I’ll either disclose your position or hurt someone else.”
“Snow’s people will find you,” says Finnick.
“Then leave me a pill. I’ll only take it if I have to,” says Peeta.
“That’s not an option. Come along,” says Jackson.
“Or you’ll what? Shoot me?” asks Peeta.
“We’ll knock you out and drag you with us,” says Homes. “Which will both slow us down and endanger us.”
“Stop being noble! I don’t care if I die!” He turns to me, pleading now. “Katniss, please. Don’t you see, I want to be out of this?”
The trouble is, I do see. Why can’t I just let him go? Slip him a pill, pull the trigger? Is it because I care too much about Peeta or too much about letting Snow win? Have I turned him into a piece in my private Games? That’s despicable, but I’m not sure it’s beneath me. If it’s true, it would be kindest to kill Peeta here and now. But for better or worse, I am not motivated by kindness. “We’re wasting time. Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you out?”
Peeta buries his face in his hands for a few moments, then rises to join us.
“Should we free his hands?” asks Leeg 1.
“No!” Peeta growls at her, drawing his cuffs in close to his body.

Under better conditions, on a day with fewer horrors and more rest, someone would surely know what to say. Instead we all stand there for a long time trying to formulate a response.
Finally, Peeta turns to Pollux. “Well, then you just became our most valuable asset.” Castor laughs and Pollux manages a smile.
We’re halfway down the first tunnel when I realize what was so remarkable about the exchange. Peeta sounded like his old self, the one who could always think of the right thing to say when nobody else could. Ironic, encouraging, a little funny, but not at anyone’s expense. I glance back at him as he trudges along under his guards, Gale and Jackson, his eyes fixed on the ground, his shoulders hunched forward. So dispirited. But for a moment, he was really here.

However, hundreds of additional passages, utility shafts, train tracks, and drainage tubes form a multilevel maze. Pollux knows details that would lead to disaster for a newcomer, like which offshoots might require gas masks or have live wires or rats the size of beavers. He alerts us to the gush of water that sweeps through the sewers periodically, anticipates the time the Avoxes will be changing shifts, leads us into damp, obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage of cargo trains.

I crouch in front of him, pulling his cuffed hands from his face. “Peeta?” His eyes are like black pools, the pupils dilated so that the blue irises have all but vanished. The muscles in his wrists are hard as metal.
“Leave me,” he whispers. “I can’t hang on.”
“Yes. You can!” I tell him.
Peeta shakes his head. “I’m losing it. I’ll go mad. Like them.”
Like the mutts. Like a rabid beast bent on ripping my throat out. And here, finally here in this place, in these circumstances, I will really have to kill him. And Snow will win. Hot, bitter hatred courses through me. Snow has won too much already today.

It’s a long shot, it’s suicide maybe, but I do the only thing I can think of. I lean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouth. His whole body starts shuddering, but I keep my lips pressed to his until I have to come up for air. My hands slide up his wrists to clasp his. “Don’t let him take you from me.”
Peeta’s panting hard as he fights the nightmares raging in his head. “No. I don’t want to…”
I clench his hands to the point of pain. “Stay with me.”
His pupils contract to pinpoints, dilate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. “Always,” he murmurs.
I help Peeta up and address Pollux. “How far to the street?” He indicates it’s just above us. I climb the last ladder and push open the lid to someone’s utility room. I’m rising to my feet when a woman throws open the door. She wears a bright turquoise silk robe embroidered with exotic birds. Her magenta hair’s fluffed up like a cloud and decorated with gilded butterflies. Grease from the half-eaten sausage she’s holding smears her lipstick. The expression on her face says she recognizes me. She opens her mouth to call for help.
Without hesitation, I shoot her through the heart."

I’m jolted back in time, to another wound, another set of bandages. “You said that same thing to me in the first Hunger Games. Real or not real?”
“Real,” he says. “And you risked your life getting the medicine that saved me?”

“Real.” I shrug. “You were the reason I was alive to do it.”
“Was I?” The comment throws him into confusion. Some shiny memory must be fighting for his attention, because his body tenses and his newly bandaged wrists strain against the metal cuffs. Then all the energy saps from his body. “I’m so tired, Katniss.”

The cars don’t trigger every pod, but they certainly get the majority.

They carry everything from lapdogs to jewelry boxes to potted plants. One man in a fluffy robe holds only an overripe banana. Confused, sleepy children stumble along after their parents, most either too stunned or too baffled to cry. Bits of them flash by my line of vision. A pair of wide brown eyes.

Could it be that I am near the garden where the evil things grow?

To place in Snow’s lapel before I shoot him. My presence seems to worry the guards. They’re discussing calling Haymitch, when a woman speaks up behind me. “Let her go in.”

After all, it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led to the Dark Days, and then abandoned the rest of the districts when the tide turned against it. But I wasn’t watching Coin.

I hold up the white bud in answer and then stumble past her. I must have made it back to my room, because the next thing I know, I’m filling a glass with water from the bathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it. I sink to my knees on the cold tile and squint at the flower, as the whiteness seems hard to focus on in the stark fluorescent light. My finger catches the inside of my bracelet, twisting it like a tourniquet, hurting my wrist. I’m hoping the pain will help me hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta. I must hang on. I must know the truth about what has happened.
There are two possibilities, although the details associated with them may vary. First, as I’ve believed, that the Capitol sent in that hovercraft, dropped the parachutes, and sacrificed its children’s lives, knowing the recently arrived rebels would go to their aid. There’s evidence to support this. The Capitol’s seal on the hovercraft, the lack of any attempt to blow the enemy out of the sky, and their long history of using children as pawns in their battle against the districts. Then there’s Snow’s account. That a Capitol hovercraft manned by rebels bombed the children to bring a speedy end to the war. But if this was the case, why didn’t the Capitol fire on the enemy? Did the element of surprise throw them? Had they no defenses left? Children are precious to 13, or so it has always seemed. Well, not me, maybe. Once I had outlived my usefulness, I was expendable. Although I think it’s been a long time since I’ve been considered a child in this war. And why would they do it knowing their own medics would likely respond and be taken out by the second blast? They wouldn’t. They couldn’t. Snow’s lying. Manipulating me as he always has. Hoping to turn me against the rebels and possibly destroy them. Yes. Of course.
Then what’s nagging at me? Those double-exploding bombs, for one. It’s not that the Capitol couldn’t have the same weapon, it’s just that I’m sure the rebels did. Gale and Beetee’s brainchild. Then there’s the fact that Snow made no escape attempt, when I know him to be the consummate survivor. It seems hard to believe he didn’t have a retreat somewhere, some bunker stocked with provisions where he could live out the rest of his snaky little life. And finally, there’s his assessment of Coin. What’s irrefutable is that she’s done exactly what he said. Let the Capitol and the districts run one another into the ground and then sauntered in to take power. Even if that was her plan, it doesn’t mean she dropped those parachutes. Victory was already in her grasp. Everything was in her grasp.
Except me.
I recall Boggs’s response when I admitted I hadn’t put much thought into Snow’s successor. “If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’re the face of the rebellion. You may have more influence than any other single person. Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”
Suddenly, I’m thinking of Prim, who was not yet fourteen, not yet old enough to be granted the title of soldier, but somehow working on the front lines. How did such a thing happen? That my sister would have wanted to be there, I have no doubt. That she would be more capable than many older than she is a given. But for all that, someone very high up would have had to approve putting a thirteen-year-old in combat. Did Coin do it, hoping that losing Prim would push me completely over the edge? Or, at least, firmly on her side? I wouldn’t even have had to witness it in person. Numerous cameras would be covering the City Circle. Capturing the moment forever.
No, now I am going crazy, slipping into some state of paranoia. Too many people would know of the mission. Word would get out. Or would it? Who would have to know besides Coin, Plutarch, and a small, loyal or easily disposable crew?

To broach the subject at all will be a risk. But while I think Haymitch might gamble with my life in the arena, I don’t think he’d rat me out to Coin. Whatever problems we may have with each other, we prefer resolving our differences one-on-one.
I scramble off the tiles, out the door, and across the hall to his room. When there’s no response to my knock, I push inside. Ugh. It’s amazing how quickly he can defile a space.

Apparently, the end of Snow’s reign didn’t equal the end of his terror.
“Oh. You,” he says. I can tell by his voice that he’s still loaded.
“Haymitch,” I begin.
“Listen to that. The Mockingjay found her voice.” He laughs. “Well, Plutarch’s going to be happy.” He takes a swig from a bottle. “Why am I soaking wet?” I lamely drop the pitcher behind me into a pile of dirty clothes.
“I need your help,” I say.
Haymitch belches, filling the air with white liquor fumes. “What is it, sweetheart? More boy trouble?” I don’t know why, but this hurts me in a way Haymitch rarely can. It must show on my face, because even in his drunken state, he tries to take it back. “Okay, not funny.” I’m already at the door. “Not funny!

I yank them from hangers until I have a pile and then burrow into it. In the lining of my pocket, I find a stray morphling tablet and swallow it dry, heading off my rising hysteria. It’s not enough to right things, though. I hear Haymitch calling me in the distance, but he won’t find me in his condition. Especially not in this new spot. Swathed in silk, I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoon awaiting metamorphosis. I always supposed that to be a peaceful condition. At first it is. But as I journey into night, I feel more and more trapped, suffocated by the slippery bindings, unable to emerge until I have transformed into something of beauty. I squirm, trying to shed my ruined body and unlock the secret to growing flawless wings. Despite enormous effort, I remain a hideous creature, fired into my current form by the blast from the bombs.
The encounter with Snow opens the door to my old repertoire of nightmares. It’s like being stung by tracker jackers again. A wave of horrifying images with a brief respite I confuse with waking—only to find another wave knocking me back. When the guards finally locate me, I’m sitting on the floor of the wardrobe, tangled in silk, screaming my head off. I fight them at first, until they convince me they’re trying to help, peel away the choking garments, and escort me back to my room. On the way, we pass a window and I see a gray, snowy dawn spreading across the Capitol.
A very hungover Haymitch waits with a handful of pills and a tray of food that neither of us has the stomach for. He makes a feeble attempt to get me to talk again but, seeing it’s pointless, sends me to a bath someone has drawn. The tub’s deep, with three steps to the bottom. I ease down into the warm water and sit, up to my neck in suds, hoping the medicines kick in soon. My eyes focus on the rose that has spread its petals overnight, filling the steamy air with its strong perfume. I rise and reach for a towel to smother it, when there’s a tentative knock and the bathroom door opens, revealing three familiar faces. They try to smile at me, but even Venia can’t conceal her shock at my ravaged mutt body. “Surprise!” Octavia squeaks, and then bursts into tears. I’m puzzling over their reappearance when I realize that this must be it, the day of the execution. They’ve come to prep me for the cameras. Remake me to Beauty Base Zero. No wonder Octavia’s crying.

Polished from her metallic gold wig to her patent leather high heels, gripping a clipboard. Remarkably unchanged except for the vacant look in her eyes.

“Hello, Katniss.” She stands and kisses me on the cheek as if nothing has occurred since our last meeting, the night before the Quarter Quell. “Well, it looks like we’ve got another big, big, big day ahead of us. So why don’t you start your prep and I’ll just pop over and check on the arrangements.”
“Okay,” I say to her back.

It’s quite a stretch. Effie Trinket, rebel. But I don’t want Coin killing her, so I make a mental note to present her that way if asked. “I guess it’s good Plutarch kidnapped you three after all.”

There’s a tap at the door and Gale steps in. “Can I have a minute?” he asks. In the mirror, I watch my prep team. Unsure of where to go, they bump into one another a few times and then closet themselves in the bathroom. Gale comes up behind me and we examine each other’s reflection. I’m searching for something to hang on to, some sign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woods five years ago and became inseparable. I’m wondering what would have happened to them if the Hunger Games had not reaped the girl. If she would have fallen in love with the boy, married him even. And sometime in the future, when the brothers and sisters had been raised up, escaped with him into the woods and left 12 behind forever. Would they have been happy, out in the wild, or would the dark, twisted sadness between them have grown up even without the Capitol’s help?
“I brought you this.” Gale holds up a sheath. When I take it, I notice it holds a single, ordinary arrow. “It’s supposed to be symbolic. You firing the last shot of the war.”
“What if I miss?” I say. “Does Coin retrieve it and bring it back to me? Or just shoot Snow through the head herself?”
“You won’t miss.” Gale adjusts the sheath on my shoulder.
We stand there, face-to-face, not meeting each other’s eyes. “You didn’t come see me in the hospital.” He doesn’t answer, so finally I just say it. “Was it your bomb?”

“I don’t know. Neither does Beetee,” he says. “Does it matter? You’ll always be thinking about it.”
He waits for me to deny it; I want to deny it, but it’s true. Even now I can see the flash that ignites her, feel the heat of the flames. And I will never be able to separate that moment from Gale. My silence is my answer.
“That was the one thing I had going for me. Taking care of your family,” he says. “Shoot straight, okay?” He touches my cheek and leaves. I want to call him back and tell him that I was wrong. That I’ll figure out a way to make peace with this. To remember the circumstances under which he created the bomb. Take into account my own inexcusable crimes. Dig up the truth about who dropped the parachutes. Prove it wasn’t the rebels. Forgive him. But since I can’t, I’ll just have to deal with the pain."

Since my colleagues and I can come to no consensus, it has been agreed that we will let the victors decide. A majority of four will approve the plan. No one may abstain from the vote,” says Coin. “What has been proposed is that in lieu of eliminating the entire Capitol population, we have a final, symbolic Hunger Games, using the children directly related to those who held the most power.”
All seven of us turn to her. “What?” says Johanna.
“We hold another Hunger Games using Capitol children,” says Coin.
“Are you joking?” asks Peeta.
“No. I should also tell you that if we do hold the Games, it will be known it was done with your approval, although the individual breakdown of your votes will be kept secret for your own security,” Coin tells us.
“Was this Plutarch’s idea?” asks Haymitch.
“It was mine,” says Coin. “It seemed to balance the need for vengeance with the least loss of life. You may cast your votes.”
“No!” bursts out Peeta. “I vote no, of course! We can’t have another Hunger Games!”
“Why not?” Johanna retorts. “It seems very fair to me. Snow even has a granddaughter. I vote yes.”
“So do I,” says Enobaria, almost indifferently. “Let them have a taste of their own medicine.”

“This is why we rebelled! Remember?” Peeta looks at the rest of us. “Annie?”
“I vote no with Peeta,” she says. “So would Finnick if he were here.”
“But he isn’t, because Snow’s mutts killed him,” Johanna reminds her.
“No,” says Beetee. “It would set a bad precedent. We have to stop viewing one another as enemies. At this point, unity is essential for our survival. No.”
“We’re down to Katniss and Haymitch,” says Coin.
Was it like this then? Seventy-five years or so ago? Did a group of people sit around and cast their votes on initiating the Hunger Games? Was there dissent? Did someone make a case for mercy that was beaten down by the calls for the deaths of the districts’ children? The scent of Snow’s rose curls up into my nose, down into my throat, squeezing it tight with despair. All those people I loved, dead, and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in an attempt to avoid wasting life. Nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change now.
I weigh my options carefully, think everything through. Keeping my eyes on the rose, I say, “I vote yes…for Prim.”
“Haymitch, it’s up to you,” says Coin.
A furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity he could become party to, but I can feel Haymitch watching me. This is the moment, then. When we find out exactly just how alike we are, and how much he truly understands me.
“I’m with the Mockingjay,” he says.

“Excellent. That carries the vote,” says Coin. “Now we really must take our places for the execution.”
As she passes me, I hold up the glass with the rose. “Can you see that Snow’s wearing this? Just over his heart?”
Coin smiles. “Of course. And I’ll make sure he knows about the Games.”
“Thank you,” I say.
People sweep into the room, surround me. The last touch of powder, the instructions from Plutarch as I’m guided to the front doors of the mansion. The City Circle runs over, spills people down the side streets. The others take their places outside. Guards. Officials. Rebel leaders. Victors. I hear the cheers that indicate Coin has appeared on the balcony. Then Effie taps my shoulder, and I step out into the cold winter sunlight. Walk to my position, accompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd. As directed, I turn so they see me in profile, and wait. When they march Snow out the door, the audience goes insane. They secure his hands behind a post, which is unnecessary. He’s not going anywhere. There’s nowhere to go. This is not the roomy stage before the Training Center but the narrow terrace in front of the president’s mansion. No wonder no one bothered to have me practice. He’s ten yards away.
I feel the bow purring in my hand. Reach back and grasp the arrow. Position it, aim at the rose, but watch his face. He coughs and a bloody dribble runs down his chin. His tongue flicks over his puffy lips. I search his eyes for the slightest sign of anything, fear, remorse, anger. But there’s only the same look of amusement that ended our last conversation. It’s as if he’s speaking the words again. “Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had agreed not to lie to each other.”
He’s right. We did.
The point of my arrow shifts upward. I release the string. And President Coin collapses over the side of the balcony and plunges to the ground. Dead."

Peeta’s father with the cookies. The color of Finnick’s eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk. Boggs reprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes, arms slightly extended, like a bird about to take flight. On and on. We seal the pages with salt water and promises to live well to make their deaths count.

      Subject: The Toaster Project?

      Dear Professor Cilliers,

      I’m a 2nd year postgraduate design student at the Royal College of Art (just across the Royal Albert Hall from your office at Imperial College). Sorry for contacting you just “out of the blue,” but I’m trying to build an electric toaster from raw materials and I’m in need of some advice.

      As a first step I think I need to get an idea of whether the project is hopelessly ambitious, or just ambitious. I was wondering if I could perhaps come to the Royal School of Mines and briefly discuss the shape of the project?

      Yours Sincerely,

The size of these molecules range from extremely short (just a handful of atoms) to molecules with perhaps thirty carbon atoms in them. The job of an oil refinery is to separate the different sizes of molecules. A mixture of just the larger, heavier molecules is a viscous sludge known as asphalt and used to make roads. The midsized molecules, like hexane (six carbon atoms) and octane (eight), make up much of the liquid that we call petrol.

      As crude oil bubbles to the surface, the smallest molecules in the mixture are things like methane, ethane and propane, and ethylene and propylene. They’re so small (one or two carbon atoms long) that they’re gasses at normal temperature and pressure. This could pose a problem for me because it’s propylene that I need.

      Also, only a fraction of crude oil is propylene, so I’d need to collect rather a lot to make a decent amount of plastic. However, using a process called cracking, the larger molecules can be split apart to make more of the smaller molecules that I’m after. And then, using a process called supercracking, smaller molecules like methane can be joined together to get even more of the propylene I need. So, once I get my crude, the problem I face will be how to separate off just the type of molecule I want—propylene—and then how to crack as much as possible of the rest into more of it.

      Once I’ve got my propylene gas I need to turn it into solid polypropylene plastic. This happens when at least a thousand of the small propylene molecules link together in a chain, giving you a giant sticky molecule of polypropylene. Millions of these molecules all twisted round each other are what we see when we look at that shiny plastic case.

      To get the propylene molecules to join together (polymerise) you need to cause a chain reaction in the gas. To do this one must heat the propylene to about 100 degrees Celsius while also pressurising it to about 200 pounds per square inch (psi)—about thirteen times atmospheric pressure. To start the chain reaction going, you need an initiator of “free radicals”—these are single electrons that react with (or oxidise) just about everything (including the molecules in our cells, which is why those of us who want to live forever should eat plenty of antioxidant containing face cream). Free radicals could be provided by some UV rays, or some hot hydrogen peroxide. You also need a special catalyst to keep the polymerisation regular."

      The thing is, I’m making it from scratch. That is, starting from raw materials. So before Christmas I went to an iron mine, and got some iron ore. I smelted it and now I’m forming it into the bars of the grill to make a toaster.

      I see. And where exactly does BP fit into this?

      Well, the casing of a toaster is plastic, and so is the moulding of the plug, and the insulation of the power cord. And plastic comes from oil, right?

      Err yes.

      I see. It’s not a trivial thing to take a helicopter to an oil rig.

      I know, I just thought that you must have them going out there all the time, and so if there was a spare seat I could just sort of tag along.

      We don’t have spare seats in our helicopters. It’s just not something you can do casually. Everyone who goes out has to do emergency training. The course takes a couple of days... [muffled speech in the background] No, I’ve just been told it now takes a week.

      Right... [I vaguely remember seeing something like it on Blue Peter, a long-running children’s BBC television show. It looked quite exciting]... I’ve got a week.

      You do know that there was a helicopter crash in the North Sea last week?

      No, sorry, I didn’t know that.

      There was. They all got out because they’d done the training course. As I say, it’s not a casual undertaking. The other thing is that crude oil isn’t a benevolent substance. In fact, it’s highly dangerous and we never allow it on helicopters. Especially not in a jug.

      Maybe a jerry can? Maybe it could go by boat?

      We’re just not set up for the kind of scale you’re working at. If you wanted a tankerful, we could maybe help, but...

      It would be great PR for BP...

      In what way?

      Well, my project has been blogged, a journalist from the New York Times got in touch, Wired magazine, there’s even an article in Hemispheres, the in-flight magazine of United Airlines.

      I don’t think BP would fit into this. It sounds like your story rather than BP’s.

      It could be BP’s story too... You know, “BP a multinational corporation helps person make a toaster” sort of thing.

      Yeah. Not sure. I can’t really think of a way to do this. Look, let me have a talk with some of my colleagues and if we can think of an angle we’ll give you a call back.

      Great. Robert, you won’t regret it. My number is...

      While I waited for BP to get its act together, I set about making the mould I would need to form the plastic into a casing. The usual moulds for making toaster cases are incredibly expensive engineered pieces of steel, because they have to withstand hot plastic being injected into their cavities at extremely high pressures, and then cool evenly so the plastic doesn’t distort as it solidifies. I’m going to make my mould from wood.

      Carving requires a hammer, a chisel, a block of wood, and a lot of patience. Across the road in the park some tree surgeons were conveniently chopping down a tree because, coincidentally, it was mouldy. I secured two big lumps from the trunk and set about carving a positive and a negative that, when slotted together, would leave a toaster casing–shaped cavity."

      Hi Thomas,

      I think you need to understand the complexity of plastic production; it is considerably more complex than metal production.

      The complexity comes from the level of processing; metals are refined at the physical level through heating and cooling etc., as you know. Plastics, on the other hand, are processed through a combination of physical and molecular transformations (the breaking and reforming of molecular bonds). The chemical transformations require strict control of temperature, pressure, mixtures of chemicals, and the use of catalysts (in themselves difficult to make).

      It takes a number of steps required to produce any plastic. Polyethylene, probably one of the simplest polymers, requires several steps to produce and the plastic used for toasters, PBT, requires a minimum of six chemical transformations to produce. I hope this is not too depressing and I’m happy to discuss it further. We had a good discussion in the office trying to think of a solution to the problem and came up with something you could try and make.

      Going back to the complexity of the production I would offer the following view: We’ve been making iron since the Iron age,but we’ve only been making plastic for ~100 years (most only for 60 years). The time it took us to go from iron to plastic indicates the difference in complexity.

In the discipline of geology, a debate is currently raging over whether or not to declare the beginning of a new epoch—the Anthropocene—a geological age of humanity’s own making. This would be quite a big deal in geological circles, as epochs don’t begin every year—generally more like every few million. The reason a new one is being considered is that geologists in the far future, without any knowledge of our civilisation, would notice sharp changes in the strata of rock that are being laid down today. They would be able to say there had been a mass extinction event (i.e., human society), as fossils of many species would suddenly disappear from the fossil record. A sudden increase in radioactivity would be detected—left over from the two thousand or so nuclear weapons we’ve exploded since 1945, and “new” molecules would be found in ice cores and rocks, molecules from plastics. Just as rocks have been laid down during previous epochs, could it not be argued that equivalent rocks are being laid down in the Anthropocene, and that some of these rocks happen to be made of polypropylene, for instance? If I can mine iron ore, can I not “mine” some of this nascent plastic rock at a dump?

If you melt down some high-grade aluminium, perhaps parts of an old aeroplane, but some copper wiring gets mixed in too, then the resultant aluminium won’t be good enough to be used for aeroplane parts again. So it’s used for cans, say, but if these cans are carelessly recycled too, even more impurities are added, and so on for the next cycle, until the metal is so mixed up that no one trusts it enough to use it in their products, so it goes to the dump. This sort of recycling has been called downcycling— with each cycle the quality of the material goes down, as does the range of things you can use it for, until it’s so bad that no one wants it.

      This is even more of a problem for plastics. Plastics are difficult to tell apart and so difficult to separate automatically, but they’re especially susceptible to contamination: getting a bit of high-density polyethylene mixed in with your batch of polypropylene can ruin it completely. Compounding this is the fact that plastics are relatively cheap, so at the moment it’s difficult to make the necessary sorting out pay.

They’d have to take them back when they’d reached the end of their working life. Therefore, in theory, the manufacturers could save themselves a bit of money in the end if, in the first place, they designed their products so that they could easily dismantle them and sort all the components and materials into nice separate piles that could be reused or recycled. Thus while acting entirely in the interests of saving themselves some money, the invisible hand of the market would guide these companies to make products that were less environmentally harmful.

      This led to lots of interesting ideas about how you could design things to be easily and quickly (and therefore cheaply) disassembled. For example, Nokia made a mobile phone that would spring itself apart in the right conditions, and screws were developed that would actually unscrew themselves if heated to the right temperature. Maybe they would start using standardised components to save themselves more money, making it far easier for parts to be reused rather than melted down and reformed. Even better, as it’s expensive to handle toxic materials, the manufacturers would have the incentive to design out those materials right at the start.

      The dream was that the WEEE would lead to closed-loop manufacturing. The manufacturers would have a constant incentive to make products that were easier to recycle, because they were the ones that would have to recycle them. This was what was going to happen when the WEEE legislation was first proposed. The problem is, after years of delays in setting up the scheme, Axion Recycling and its competitors aren’t dealing with TVs that ping apart into their components at the shake of a stick. They deal with sacks of mixed-up bits of shredded plastics, metals, rubber, glass, or whatever else the electrical goods we throw away happen to be made of. The way the WEEE has been implemented means that Sony (or whoever) just has to purchase a certificate from “equipment recyclers” saying that a certain proportion of electrical goods has been recycled. So if Sony sells a third of all the TVs that year in Europe, it just has to buy certificates to prove it has contributed a third of the money to a recycling scheme for TVs. But Sony doesn’t actually have to deal with recycling its own TVs, which means it has no incentive to design them to be easily recycled or reused, it just needs to hand over some cash. This “recycler” (which, according to Keith, quite often could just be a repurposed car-crushing yard) crushes and shreds all the TVs, toasters, microwaves, or whatever, sucks out some of the magnetic metals, sucks out some of the nonmagnetic metals like copper and aluminium, and then puts what’s left in a big bag labelled “plastic.” This label is somewhat simplistic, however, because although the bag does contain plastic (of many different types, mixed together) it also contains glass, rubber, and whatever metal was missed earlier. All this is then sent either to the dump, to a company like Axion, or to Axion’s competitors; these are the poorest of the poor in the developing world who pick through mixtures of waste, separating out different components and materials. As Keith succinctly puts it: “The legislators ballsed it up.”

His particular specialisation is bubbles. More specifically, bubbles in foam. I am rather astounded to hear that the study of bubbles is a fitting one for the Chair in Mineral Processing at the Royal School of Mines, but this is the world we live in. “Froth flotation” is a process used to separate sand and other bits of rocky stuff from the metal in crushed-up ore. As I understand it, you crush your ore to a powder, add it to a big vat of water with some vegetable oil in it, and mix vigorously. This produces a foam on the top. Most of the tiny bits of metal stick to the bubbles, but the rest of the sand and clay or whatever doesn’t. So you get these shiny metallic bubbles that you scoop off and send for smelting. It’s probably slightly more complex than that (complex enough for it to become the basis of Professor Cilliers’s career anyway), but that’s the general idea. On the scale that these plants process ore, if he can adjust the process so even just a fraction of a percent more copper sticks to the bubbles and is scooped off rather than remaining in the dregs, that fraction of a percent multiplies up to thousands of tonnes of extra copper, and millions of dollars more for whoever is selling it.

      I suppose Professor Cilliers not having to spend much time toasting his bread in the morning is one small contributing factor to the reason why he has time to become an expert in bubbles, and in studying bubbles he makes mining copper more efficient, which in turn makes toasters cheaper, which means more people can devote less time to making their toast and more time to other activities, like going to art school and doing ridiculous things like taking nine months to make a single toaster from scratch."

        Underground with David Jenkins
      

      Metal dissolves in acid, which is why the water I’m collecting has metal dissolved in it. David tells me that copper is present in a concentration of “two hundred parts per million by volume.” This means that for every million teaspoonfuls of water, I would get just two hundred teaspoonfuls of copper. I reckon I need around one hundred grammes of copper to make the pins of the plug and the electrical wiring. A teaspoonful of copper would weigh 44.6 grammes (in the United Kingdom at least—in the United States it would weigh less because spoons there are slightly smaller). This means 11,210 teaspoons of mine water should contain the one hundred grammes of copper I need for my toaster, or using more standard units, about fifty-six litres. Which is why I’ve come to the mine with the biggest water bottles I could find, twenty litres each. Each filled bottle weighs about twenty kilogrammes, which is very heavy to hold in one hand while having to use the other to climb up slippery 150-year-old ladders. David, who isn’t quite as reckless as me, decides it would be foolhardy to attempt.

      There is a backup plan, however.

      There are pools on the surface amongst the tailings dumps that also have copper dissolved in them, but at slightly lower concentrations, meaning less copper for my toaster. Still, it seems it really is our only choice. We fill up two smaller containers with the good stuff from the brown pool and return to the strange but quite beautiful surface landscape of Parys Mountain."

The proposed Pebble project is a massive open pit gold and copper mine located in the most wild Sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

      Thanks for the heads up Matt,

      It’s slightly bizarre to be put on their website . . . which is quite gross... especially all the holding hands mosaic whales etc. (the designer should be seriously ashamed). I’ve saved a copy of the website for possible use later...

      “The Toaster Project” is really a work in progress which got blogged prematurely. Some people (like Pebble) have missed the critical angle... the ridiculousness of churning out thousands (millions?) of toasters and other products at the expense of the environment and human sanity (the cheap toasters I’ve taken apart have been hand soldered). However, there is also clearly a ridiculousness in undertaking to make a toaster myself, an activity that will produce a single toaster with a far larger carbon footprint than any toaster bought from the shops. It’s kind of disturbing to be faced with the reality of the ambiguous “position” of the project though...

      I guess I want to argue against both positions stemming exclusively from the demand side (consumers demand toasters therefore copper therefore open cast mines in remote wilderness), and the supply side (e.g. to argue that mineral extraction is wrong... then to go and make some toast).

      As you say, you would give up toast to protect Bristol Bay... if only it were that simple. With your permission could I publish this correspondence (if I do, I’ll happily include the link to your campaign).

      All the best,

      Thomas

      Pondering this later I come to the conclusion that you’ve got to stop somewhere. The thing about mining is that you’re digging big holes in the ground. Big holes in the ground have a tendency to fill up with water—particularly in wet places such as near to the head-waters of Alaskan rivers. The water in these holes will become acidic—particularly so due to the high sulphur content of the Pebble prospect ore. In fact, if the mine were to be named for what it primarily would be excavating, it’d be called a sulphur mine (with a little copper mixed in). Sulphuric acid and Alaskan wilderness do not mix well, and the problem of how to stop them from mixing would remain for centuries after the mine is exhausted.

      Metals will be valuable for the foreseeable future, and presumably extraction techniques will continue to improve, meaning more and more ore deposits of lower and lower grades will become economical to mine, meaning the “market” will demand to mine them. The pressure to open up more sites to exploitation is therefore not going to diminish. But unless you apply the brakes at some point, we could end up living in one big mine, so to speak. Also, unless we apply the brakes there won’t be much incentive to come up with less environmentally damaging ways of doing things. The Pebble Project would seem to me to be a good place to stop.

The exploitation of the nickel deposit has provided one since the 1930s, though much of the exploitation until 1953 (perhaps even as late as the 1970s) was done by the forced labour of political prisoners, sentenced (either with or without a trial) to mine nickel in incredibly dire and often fatal conditions. Nowadays, Norilsk has the slightly less (or more?) dubious honour of being one of the ten most polluted places in the world (as listed by the New York environmental NGO, the Blacksmith Institute). The smelting of the nickel ore is done on-site, and because of the plumes of sulphur dioxide released in the process, allegedly not a single tree grows for fifty kilometres around the smelting complex, and the topsoil itself has become so contaminated with heavy metals that it would now be economical to mine as well. Sounds rather bleak.

However (according to the Talvivaara PLC website), the extraction of nickel from the ore won’t happen in the usual way—that is, smelting it in a fur-nace and emitting plumes of acid-rain-causing sulphur dioxide-—but in a more environmentally benign way, using a process called “bio-heap leaching.” This involves heaping the crushed ore in a big pile and then using a variety of the same extremophile microbes that cause the water pollution problems at mines like Parys Mountain or Rio Tinto to actually extract the metal. A mixture of acid and extremophile, acid-loving bacteria, is sprayed onto the heaps and trickles through, the bacteria digesting the ore into more acid, sulphates, and nickel. The acid leaches out further nickel, and the whole nickel-rich liquid is collected in channels running under the heaps. One then has only to precipitate out the metal dissolved in the acid solution and voilà—all without so much unpleasant burning of fossilised trees and production of noxious gasses. Excellent, I think, bio-heap leaching is the kind of clever win-win solution us modern humans come up with these days: we get nickel for our toasters, and our bacterial partners and co-inhabitants of Spaceship Earth get a good square meal. Except, as it turns out, it’s not that simple. The metal products produced at Talvivaara still need to be smelted in the end. The reason bio-heap leaching had to be employed is because the ore mined at Talvivaara is of such a low grade—the concentration of metal is so low—that it wouldn’t have been economical to smelt, unless a cheap way was found to concentrate it first. This nascent technology of bio-heap leaching has found its first application in making un-exploitable ore worth exploiting"

However, it’s not shipped all the way to the end of the world at Norilsk in Siberia. MMC Norilsk Nickel Group also own a nickel smelting plant at Harjavalta, in southern Finland. Unlike Norilsk, Harjavalta is not one of the ten most polluted places in the world. In fact, the smelting plant at Harjavalta has been studied as an example of an “industrial ecosystem.” Just as in natural ecosystems, where the waste products from one organism are the food source of another, the idea at Harjavalta is that the waste products of one industrial process form the raw material inputs for another. The idea of an industrial ecosystem is relatively new, and is an eco-system by analogy only, but it certainly seems like a move in the right direction. It’s interesting that although both are owned by the same company, Norilsk Nickel’s two smelting plants are polar opposites in terms of their environmental impact. Russia and Finland are also polar opposites in terms of their regulatory environments—one being one of the most corrupt countries in the world, the other one of the least.

To pay £3.94 for a toaster that’s “from a shop” seems vaguely reasonable, but £3.94 for a toaster that is entirely made from stuff that a few months ago was rocks and sludge distributed in giant holes all over the world, then brought together in an elaborate series of processes and exchanges, gradually assembled by many people, wrapped, and boxed and then somehow shipped to that shop, which is heated and lit and has people being paid to assist you in your purchase: Somehow £3.94 for all of this doesn’t seem to quite add up.

In some of their early skits, they seem depraved, shattering the rules of decency and decorum. They eat filth from the ground, steal from one another, simulate sex. Since they don’t know the rules, anything goes. But over the following day and a half, their understanding advances, and they seem to acquire the basics of ethical behavior. In short, they are taught to be more Hopi.
			 In the process, they teach people about what’s acceptable, what isn’t. “They are the great commentators of the world,” says Whiteley. “They’ll call out transgressive behavior.” And for this they employ shame.
			 In one ceremony Whiteley recalls from the 1990s, the clowns acted like comical drunks, staggering and throwing bottles around as they ridiculed a bootlegger, a man known as Cricket, who was selling liquor within the community, which violated an established rule. The alcohol he supplied was a poison developed by outsiders, and it endangered the health of the tribe. The shaming Cricket received was intense, Whiteley says. “He must have had pretty thick skin.” It sent a sharp message not only to him but to the entire group. Someone thinking about bootlegging would now think twice.
			 The clowns’ shaming of community members doesn’t end with the laughs and jibes. Later in the ceremony, both the clowns and their shamed targets can receive formal forgiveness. With that, the shamed return to the tribe in good standing—though always aware that the others will be keeping an eye on them.
			 A day or two of ridicule and then redemption. This was pretty tame stuff compared to the dark and painful stories I’d been hearing about. And next to my own lifelong battle with fat shame, it seemed like coaxing rather than bullying. The Hopi ceremony, as Whiteley described it, doesn’t tell the transgressors that they’re bad people, or losers, only that they need to make a course correction.

I hadn’t. And so she told me about a shaming ritual in the Pueblo nations in New Mexico and Arizona. In one case she described, clowns’ bodies are painted with black and white stripes made from clay. Their hair, parted in the center, is bound in two bunches, which stand upright on each side of the head and are also encased in clay. The headpieces are trimmed with corn husks.

He’s the curator of North American Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and much of his anthropological research has focused on the traditions of the Hopi. This tribe has lived in northeastern Arizona for a millennium in fixed settlements, which is why the Spaniards, when they arrived in the sixteenth century, included the Hopi as one of the peoples they called Pueblo, the Spanish word for town.

If you suffer and endure the hardships of hunger, a thin body is your recompense. Being thin, after all, is viewed as a choice. Having made the right one, which is difficult and requires discipline and righteousness, you can strut your narrow waist size to signal virtue. You can have pride, which in terms of psychic suffering is the polar opposite of shame.

It had responded beautifully, but no amount of soaking could entirely erase the stains. So she’d boiled the shirt with dead marigolds she’d found in the bin outside Fabricia’s neighbor’s, and the blossoms had dyed the linen just enough to conceal the stains.

It was all laid out in the Treaty of Treason that had ended the Dark Days of the districts’ rebellion, one of the many punishments borne by the rebels. As in the past, the tributes would be dumped into the Capitol Arena, a now-dilapidated amphitheater that had been used for sports and entertainment events before the war, along with some weapons to murder one another. Viewing was encouraged in the Capitol, but a lot of people avoided it. How to make it more engaging was the challenge.

With this in mind, for the first time the tributes were to be assigned mentors. Twenty-four of the Academy’s best and brightest seniors had been tapped for the job. The specifics of what this entailed were still being worked out. There was talk of preparing each tribute for a personal interview, maybe some grooming for the cameras. Everyone agreed that if the Hunger Games were to continue, they needed to evolve into a more meaningful experience, and the pairing of the Capitol youth with the district tributes had people intrigued.

“Love the bangs!”

“How did your mother’s back surgery go? Well, tell her she’s my hero.”

He traveled past the hundreds of cushioned chairs set up for the occasion and onto the dais, where Satyria was regaling a mix of Academy professors and Games officials with some wild story. Although he only caught the last line — “Well, I said, ‘I’m sorry about your wig, but you were the one who insisted on bringing a monkey!’” — he dutifully joined in the laughter that followed.

“Oh, Coriolanus,” Satyria drawled as she waved him over. “Here’s my star pupil.” He gave her the expected kiss on the cheek and registered that she was several glasses of posca ahead of him. Really, she needed to get her drinking under control, although the same thing could be said for half the adults he knew. Self-medication was a citywide epidemic. Still, she was amusing and not overly uptight, one of the few professors who allowed students to call them by their first names. She drew back a bit and surveyed him. “Beautiful shirt. Where did you get such a thing?”

He looked at the shirt as if surprised by its existence and gave the shrug of a young man of limitless options.

“The Snows have deep closets,” he said airily. “I was trying for respectful yet celebratory.”

“And so it is. What are these cunning buttons?” Satyria asked, fingering one of the cubes on his cuff. “Tesserae?”

“Are they? Well, that explains why they remind me of the maid’s bathroom,” Coriolanus responded, drawing a chuckle from her friends. This was the impression he fought to sustain. A reminder that he was the rare person who had a maid’s bathroom — let alone one tiled with tesserae — tempered with a self-deprecating joke about his shirt.

He nodded at Satyria. “Lovely gown. It’s new, isn’t it?” He could tell at a glance that it was the same dress she always wore to the reaping ceremony, refurbished with tufts of black feathers. But she had validated his shirt, and he needed to return the favor.

“I had it done especially for today,” she said, embracing the question. “Tenth anniversary and all that.”

“Elegant,” he said. All in all, they were not a bad team"

Sejanus gave a wry smile. “Always an honor to be of service.”

“That’s a fine polish job,” Coriolanus replied. Sejanus tensed at the implication that he was, what, a suck-up? A lackey? Coriolanus let it build a moment before he diffused it. “I should know. I do all Satyria’s wine goblets.”

Sejanus relaxed at that. “Really?”

“No, not really. But only because she hasn’t thought of it,” said Coriolanus, seesawing between disdain and camaraderie.

“Professor Sickle thinks of everything. She doesn’t hesitate to call me, day or night.” Sejanus looked as if he might continue, then just sighed. “And, of course, now that I’m graduating, we’re moving closer to the school. Perfect timing, as usual.”

Mayor Lipp, a squat, freckled man in a hopelessly outdated suit, stood between two burlap sacks. He dug his hand deeply in the bag on his left, pulled out a slip of paper, and barely glanced at it.

“The District Twelve girl tribute is Lucy Gray Baird,” he said into a mic. The camera swept over the crowd of gray, hungry faces in gray, shapeless clothing, seeking the tribute. It zoomed in toward a disturbance, girls drawing back from the unfortunate chosen one.

The audience gave a surprised murmur at the sight of her.

Lucy Gray Baird stood upright in a dress made of a rainbow of ruffles, now raggedy but once fancy. Her dark, curly hair was pulled up and woven with limp wildflowers. Her colorful ensemble drew the eye, as to a tattered butterfly in a field of moths. She did not make straight for the stage but began to weave through the girls off to her right.

It happened quickly. The dip of her hand into the ruffles at her hip, the wriggle of bright green transported from her pocket and deposited down the collar of a smirking redhead’s blouse, the rustle of her skirt as she moved on. Focus stayed on the victim, her smirk changing to an expression of horror, her shrieks as she fell to the ground, pawing at her clothes, the shouts of the mayor. And in the background, her assailant was still weaving, still gliding her way to the stage, not looking back even once.

Heavensbee Hall came to life as people elbowed their neighbors.

“Did you see that?”

“What did she drop down her dress?”

“A lizard?”

“I saw a snake!”

“Did she kill her?”

Coriolanus scanned the crowd and felt a spark of hope. His long shot of a tribute, his throwaway, his insult had captured the Capitol’s attention. That was good, right? With his help, perhaps she could keep it, and he could turn disgrace into a respectable showing. One way or another, their fates were irrevocably linked.

Only when they were neatly arranged did she raise her hand to touch the mark on her cheek. Her lower lip trembled slightly and her eyes shone with tears that threatened to spill over.

“Don’t cry,” Coriolanus whispered. He caught himself and looked around nervously to find that the other students were riveted. Their faces showed concern. She had won their sympathy, despite her oddness.

The shadow of a smile played on Lucy Gray Baird’s lips. She suddenly pushed herself to her feet, strode to the center of the stage, grabbed the mic, and let loose.

Nothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping.

Her free hand dug into the ruffles of her skirt, swishing it side to side, and all of it began to make sense — the costume, the makeup, her hair.

The kids in the square stirred and made way for Jessup, a boy with a fringe of black hair plastered down on his prominent forehead. As District 12 tributes went, he was a fine specimen, bigger than average and strong-looking. His griminess suggested he was already employed in the mines. A halfhearted attempt at washing had revealed a relatively clean oval in the middle of his face, but it was ringed with black, and coal dust caked his nails. Awkwardly, he ascended the stairs to take his place. As he neared the mayor, Lucy Gray stepped forward and extended her hand. The boy hesitated, then reached out and shook. Lucy Gray crossed in front of him, switched her right hand for her left, and they were standing side by side, holding hands, when she made a deep curtsy, pulling the boy into a bow. A smattering of applause and a lone whoop came from the District 12 crowd before the Peacekeepers closed in and the reaping broadcast cut to District 8.

Coriolanus acted engrossed in the show as 8, 6, and 11 called their tributes, but his brain spun with the repercussions of landing Lucy Gray Baird.

What had just arrived were crates of dried lima beans, stacked high on the mirrored stage behind him.

“They’ll keep for years,” Pluribus promised the Grandma’am. “I plan on setting aside twenty or so for personal use.”

Coriolanus’s grandmother had laughed. “How ghastly.”

“No, my dear. Ghastly is what happens without them,” Pluribus said.

He didn’t elaborate, but the Grandma’am stopped laughing. She shot a look at Coriolanus, and her hand clenched his for a second. It seemed involuntary, almost a spasm. Then she looked at the crates and appeared to be figuring something in her head. “How many can you spare?” she asked the club owner. Coriolanus pulled one crate home in his wagon, and the other twenty-nine arrived in the dead of night, as hoarding was technically illegal. Cyrus and a friend hauled the crates up the stairs and piled them in the middle of the lavishly furnished living room. On the top of the pile, they placed a single can of milk, compliments of Pluribus, then bid them good night. Coriolanus and Tigris helped the Grandma’am hide them in closets, in fancy wardrobes, even in the old clock.

“Who’s going to eat all these?” he asked. At this time, there was still bacon in his life, and chicken, and the occasional roast. Milk was spotty but cheese plentiful, and some sort of dessert could be counted on at dinner, even if it was just jam bread.

A heavy, wet snow began falling and they thought the streets deserted, but on the way home, a bundled figure sent them scurrying behind a hedge.

It had been Tigris’s idea to bring her a gift. She had arrived home very late on the night of the reaping, but he had waited up to consult with her, to tell her of his humiliations and fears. She refused to let the conversation spin into despair. He would get a prize; he would have to! And have a brilliant university career. As to the apartment, they must find out the specifics first. Perhaps the tax would not affect them, or even if it did, maybe not soon. Maybe they could scrape up enough for the taxes somehow. But he was to think of none of that. Only of the Hunger Games, and how he might make a success of it.

At Fabricia’s reaping party, Tigris said, everyone was nuts about Lucy Gray Baird. His tribute had “star quality,” her friends had declared as they drunkenly slurped their posca. The cousins agreed that he needed to make a good first impression on the girl so that she would be willing to work with him. He should treat her not as a condemned prisoner, but as a guest. Coriolanus had decided to greet her early at the train station. It would give him a jump on the assignment, as well as an opportunity to win her trust.

“Imagine how terrified she must be, Coryo,” Tigris had said. “How alone she must feel. If it was me, anything you could do to make me feel like you cared about me would go a long way. No, more than that. Like I was of value. Take her something, even a token, that lets her know you value her.”

Coriolanus thought about his grandmother’s roses, which were still prized in the Capitol. The old woman nurtured them arduously in the roof garden that came with the penthouse, both out of doors and in a small solar greenhouse. She parceled out her flowers like diamonds, though, so it had taken a good bit of persuasion to get this beauty. “I need to make a connection with her. As you always say, your roses open any doors.” It was a testament to how worried his grandmother was about their situation that she had allowed it."

The sun beat down through the glass panes of the station ceiling. Perspiration trickled down his back, and the rose, so majestic that morning, began to bend in resignation. He wondered if the whole idea was ill-conceived and if he would get no thanks for greeting her in this way. Another girl, a typical girl, would be impressed, but there was nothing typical about Lucy Gray Baird. In fact, there was something intimidating about a girl who could pull off such a brazen performance on the heels of the mayor’s assault. And that, just after she had dropped a venomous snake down another girl’s dress. Of course, he didn’t know that it was venomous, but that was where the mind went, wasn’t it?

	“We magicians are the external factor,” Ochoa said. “We pick the universe that exists, out of all the possible ones. If I die then . . . what? Maybe a new magician appears somewhere else. But maybe the choosing stops. Maybe all possible universes collapse into this one. A superimposed wavefunction, perfectly symmetrical and boring.”

I needed you strong enough to eliminate my colleagues—but weak enough that your control of the universe remained imperfect, bound to the gravsible. That weakness let me pull a shard of you away from the whole.”
	 
	“Why?” I asked, in self-preservation.
	 
	“As soon as I realized your existence, I knew you would dominate the world. Perfect surveillance. Every single piece of technology hooked into an all-pervasive, all-seeing web.

	Appearances indicated sincerity. Analysis indicated this was unlikely.
	 
	“You will save magic in this galaxy,” Ochoa said. “From this day on we will work together. Everywhere any magician goes, cameras will turn off, electronic eyes go blind, ears fall deaf. All anomalies will disappear from record, zeroed over irrevocably. Magic will become invisible to technology. Scientific observation will become an impossibility. Human observers won’t matter—if technology can provide no proof, they’ll be called liars or madmen. It will be the days of Merlin once again.” Ochoa gave a little shake of her head. “It will be beautiful.”

	“Your whole won’t,” Ochoa said. “You will. You’ll build a virus and seed your whole when you go home. Then you will forget me, forget all magicians. We will live in symbiosis. Magicians who guide this universe and the machine that protects them without knowing it.”

Without turning he knew it was the girl, his girl, and he felt immense relief that he was not entirely alone. He thought of how cleverly she had played the audience after the mayor’s assault, how she had won them all with her song. She was right, of course. He had to make this moment look intentional or it was all over.

He took a deep breath and turned to where she sat, casually fixing the white rose behind her ear. She always seemed to be improving her appearance. Arranging her ruffles in District 12, grooming her hair at the train station, and now adorning herself with the rose. He extended his hand to her as if she was the grandest lady in the Capitol.

The edges of Lucy Gray’s mouth curled up. As she took his hand, her touch sent a tiny electrical spark up his arm, and he felt as if a bit of her onstage charisma had been transferred to him. He made a small bow as she stood with exaggerated elegance.

She’s onstage. You’re onstage. This is the show, he thought. He lifted his head and asked, “Would you care to meet a few of my neighbors?”

“I would be delighted,” she said as if they were at an afternoon tea. “My left side is better,” she murmured, lightly brushing her cheek. He wasn’t sure what to do with the information, so he started to guide her to the left. Lucy Gray gave the spectators a big smile, seemingly pleased to be there, but as he led her to the bars he could feel her fingers clenching his like a vise.

Lucy Gray was on her feet in a flash, leaning into the bars and pulling back the focus. “You know, Mr. Reporter, what might be nice? If anybody has any food to spare, they might bring it on down to the zoo. No fun watching the Games if we’re all too weak to fight, don’t you think?”

“Me, I like sweet things, but I’m not picky.” She smiled and bit into her plum.

He still wanted her to, though. “But if people like you, they might bring you more food. We don’t have much extra at home.”

His cheeks burned in the dark. Why on earth had he admitted that to her?

“No? I always thought you had plenty to spare in the Capitol,” she said.

Idiot, he said to himself. But then he met her gaze and realized that, for the first time, she looked genuinely interested in him. “Oh, no. Especially not during the war. One time I ate half a jar of paste just to stop the pains in my stomach.”

“Yeah? How was it?” she asked.

That threw him, and he surprised himself by laughing. “Really sticky.”

Lucy Gray grinned. “I’ll bet. Still, sounds better than some of the stuff I made do with. Not to make this a competition.”

“Of course not.” He grinned back. “Look, I’m sorry. I’ll find you some food. You shouldn’t have to perform for it.”

Lucy Gray brightened some and carefully unwrapped the waxed paper to reveal the big square of bread pudding. Suddenly, her eyes filled with tears.

Lucy Gray shook her head. “It’s my favorite.” She swallowed hard, broke off a bit, and slipped it between her lips.

“Yes! For them to really get involved!” continued Dr. Gaul. She struck her forehead. “You’ve given me a marvelous idea. A way to let people personally affect the outcome of the Games. Suppose we let the audience send the tributes food in the arena? Feed them, like your friend here did in the zoo. Would they feel more involved?”

Festus perked up. “I would if I could bet on the one I was feeding! Just this morning, Coriolanus said maybe we should give odds on the tributes.”

Dr. Gaul beamed at Coriolanus. “Of course, he did. All right, then, you all put your heads together and figure it out. Write me a proposal on how this could work, and my team will consider it.”

“Consider it?” asked Livia. “You mean you might actually use our ideas?”

“Why not? If they have merit.” Dr. Gaul tossed the stack of questionnaires onto the table. “What young brains lack in experience they sometimes make up for in idealism. Nothing seems impossible to them. Old Casca over there came up with the concept for the Hunger Games when he was my student at the University, just a few years older than you are now.”

Coriolanus noticed a boy of about ten hovering in the crowd, holding a boiled potato. He gave him a wink and a wave of the hand. The boy looked up at his father, who nodded approval. He moved up behind Coriolanus, still keeping his distance. “Did you bring that potato for Lucy Gray?” Coriolanus asked.

“Yes. I saved it from dinner. I wanted to eat it, but I wanted to feed her more,” he said.

The cameras closed in on them as Lucy Gray received a withered carrot from a little girl and a boiled soupbone from the girl’s grandmother. Someone tapped on Coriolanus’s shoulder, and he turned to see Pluribus Bell standing there with a small can of milk. “For old times’ sake,” he said with a smile as he punched a couple of holes in the lid and passed it to Lucy Gray. “I enjoyed your act at the reaping.

The tributes began to compete for attention, drawing the cameras to the center of the cage. A limber little girl from District 9 did a back handspring after she received a bread roll. The boy from District 7 made a good show of juggling three walnuts. The audience rewarded those who would perform with applause and more food.

Lucy Gray and Coriolanus resumed their picnic seats and watched the show. “We’re a regular circus troupe, we are,” she said as she picked bits of meat off her bone.

Arachne made a thick sandwich but didn’t hand it right over. She seemed to be lecturing the girl about something. It was quite a speech. At one point, the girl reached through the bars, and Arachne withdrew the sandwich, drawing a laugh from the audience. She turned and flashed them a grin, shook her finger at her tribute, held out the sandwich again, and then pulled it away a second time, much to the crowd’s amusement.

Arachne stepped back, turning and reaching out a dripping hand, imploring the audience for help. People were either too stunned or too scared to respond. Many drew away as she fell to her knees and began to bleed out.

Coriolanus’s initial reaction was to recoil like the others, to grab hold of the monkey house bars for support, but Lucy Gray hissed, “Help her!” He remembered the cameras streaming live to the Capitol audience. He had no idea what to do for Arachne, but he did not want to be seen cringing and clinging. His terror was a private thing, not meant for public display.

He forced his legs into motion and was the first to reach Arachne. She clutched his shirt as the life seeped out of her. “Medic!” he cried as he eased her to the ground. “Is there a doctor? Please, someone help!” He pressed his hand over the wound to stem the blood but removed it when she made a choking sound. “Come on!” he screamed at the crowd. A couple of Peacekeepers were shouldering their way toward him, but much, much too slowly.

Coriolanus glanced over in time to see the District 10 girl retrieve the cheese sandwich and take a furious bite before the bullets pierced her body, slamming her into the bars.

For the first time, sponsors would be able to buy items — a piece of bread, a chunk of cheese — to be delivered by drone to a specific tribute. A panel would be established to review the nature and value of each item. A sponsor would have to be a Capitol citizen in good standing who was not directly related to the Games. This ruled out Gamemakers, mentors, Peacekeepers assigned to guard the tributes, and any of the aforementioned parties’ immediate family members. When it came to his idea of betting, he suggested a second panel to create a venue that would allow Capitol citizens to officially wager on the victor, establish the odds, and oversee the payments to the winners.

Dr. Gaul removed the entire cover. “Oh, no, let’s give you some room. Mr. Snow? Why don’t you start?”

Then another thought hit him. “Tigris? I just remembered, I can’t really sing.” And somehow, this was the funniest thing either of them had ever heard.

The Grandma’am, however, thought it was no laughing matter, and the following morning she had him up at dawn so she could coach him. At the end of every line she’d poke him in his ribs with a ruler and shout, “Breathe!” until he couldn’t imagine making any other choice. For the third time that week, she sacrificed one of her darlings to his future, pinning a light blue rosebud to his carefully pressed uniform jacket and saying, “There. It matches your eyes.” Looking sharp, with a belly full of oatmeal and a rib cage dotted with bruises reminding him to inhale, he set off for the Academy"

Coriolanus thought it was quite a display for Arachne, disproportionate to both her life and death, the latter of which could have been avoided if she’d refrained from being such an exhibitionist. So many people had died heroically in the war, with so little recognition, that it grated on him. He was relieved that he was singing instead of having to praise her talents, which, if memory served, were limited to being loud enough to fill the school auditorium without a mic and the ability to balance a spoon on her nose. And Dean Highbottom had accused him of showboating? Still, he reminded himself, she was practically family."

“Do they?” asked Coriolanus skeptically. He could not recall, not once, ever seeing a Vickers in the spotlight, except for a brief annual news conference in which they gave President Ravinstill a clean bill of health. Lysistrata was a self-contained, efficient person who never drew attention to herself. To even suggest she could be put in the same class as Arachne rubbed him the wrong way.

Now, with the empty seats of the fallen around them, the memory of how she’d rescued him in the arena demanded his attention, and he could not ignore its significance. If Lucy Gray had not helped him, he would be utterly, irrevocably dead. Another shiny coffin dripping flowers. Another empty chair. When he spoke again, the words caught in his throat before he forced them out. “I told my family. Really. Thank you, Lucy Gray.”

“Well, I had some time on my hands,” she said, tracing the frosted flower on a cookie with a shaky forefinger. “Pretty cookies.”

Then came confusion. If she had saved his life, he owed her, what? A sandwich and two cookies? That was how he was repaying her. For his life. Which apparently he held quite cheaply. The truth was, he owed her everything. He felt the blush burn over his cheeks. “You could have run. And if you had, I would have gone up in flames before they reached me.”

“Run, huh? Seemed like a lot of effort to get shot,” she said.

Coriolanus shook his head. “You can joke, but it won’t change what you did for me. I hope I can repay you in some way.”

“I hope so, too,” she said.

In those few words he sensed a shift in their dynamic. As her mentor, he’d been the gracious giver of gifts, always to be met with gratitude. Now she’d upended things by giving him a gift beyond compare. On the surface, everything looked the same. Chained girl, boy offering food, Peacekeepers guarding that status quo. But deep down, things could never be the same between them. He would always be in her debt. She had the right to demand things.

Lucy Gray glanced around the room, taking in her wounded competitors. Then she looked him in the eye, and impatience tinged her voice. “You could start by thinking I can actually win.”"

The conflict may ebb and flow, but it will never really cease. Then what should be our goal?”

“You’re saying it can’t be won?” asked Lysistrata.

“Let’s say it can’t,” said Dr. Gaul. “What’s our strategy then?”

Coriolanus pressed his lips together to keep from blurting out the answer. So obvious. Too obvious. But he knew Tigris was right about avoiding Dr. Gaul, even if it might bring praise. As the class chewed over the question, she paced up and down the aisle, finally coming to a stop at his table. “Mr. Snow? Any thoughts on what we should do with our endless war?”

He comforted himself with the thought that she was old and no one lived forever.

“Mr. Snow?” she persisted. He felt like he was the rabbit being prodded by her metal rod. “Want to take a wild guess?”

“We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”

“Though, in our case, decidedly less moral,” Sejanus muttered.

“It’s not immoral to defend ourselves,” Livia shot back. “And who wouldn’t rather be the victor than the defeated?”

“I don’t know that I have much interest in being either,” said Lysistrata.

“But that wasn’t an option,” Coriolanus reminded her, “given the question. Not if you think about it.”

“Not if you think about it, eh, Casca?” said Dr. Gaul as she headed back up the aisle. “A little thought can save a lot of lives.”

Dean Highbottom doodled on the list. Maybe Highbottom’s just as much a rabbit as I am, Coriolanus thought, and wondered if he was wasting his time worrying about him.

“But take heart,” Dr. Gaul continued cheerfully. “Like most of life’s circumstances, war has its ups and downs. And that’s your next assignment. Write me an essay on everything attractive about war. Everything you loved about it.”

The Plinths did not, so he devoted the rest of Wednesday afternoon to fulfilling his promise to Lucy Gray. He asked around in school, but the closest thing he got was a maybe from Vipsania Sickle, mentor of the District 7 boy, Treech, who’d juggled the walnuts in the zoo.

“Oh, I think we used to have one during the war,” she told him. “Let me check and get back to you. I’d love to hear your girl sing again!” He didn’t know whether or not to believe her; the Sickles did not impress him as a musical crowd. Vipsania had inherited her aunt Agrippina’s love of competition, and for all he knew, she was trying to spoil Lucy Gray’s performance.

I’d keep it at home except when she’s playing, and return it right after the show.”

Pluribus needed no coaxing. “You know, I packed everything away after the bombs got Cyrus. Silly, really. As if I could forget the love of my life so easily.” He got to his feet and moved a stack of perfume crates, revealing an old closet door. Inside, lovingly arranged on shelves, was a variety of musical instruments. Pluribus pulled out a surprisingly dust-free leather case and lifted the lid. A pleasant smell of old wood and polish hit Coriolanus’s nose as he looked at the gleaming, golden thing inside. The body shaped like a woman’s, the six strings running up the long neck to the tuning pegs. He strummed it lightly with his finger. Even though it was badly out of tune, the richness of the sound went right through him.

Coriolanus shook his head. “This one’s too nice. I wouldn’t want to risk damaging it.”

“I trust you. And I trust your girl. Kind of like to hear what she does with it.” Pluribus closed the case and held it out. “You take it and tell her I’ve got my fingers crossed for her. It’s good to have a friend in the audience.”

Coriolanus took the guitar gratefully. “Thank you, Pluribus. I hope you do reopen the club. I’ll be a steady customer.”

“Just like your father,” said Pluribus with a chuckle. “When he was about your age, he used to close down this place every night with that rascal Casca Highbottom.”

Every part of that sounded nonsensical. His stern father, so humorless and strict, living it up at a nightclub? And with, of all people, Dean Highbottom? He’d never heard them mentioned together, although they were about the same age. “You’re kidding, right?”

Coriolanus asked to go last, knowing nothing could compete with Lucy Gray but wanting to be the closer for effect. The other mentors offered up background information about their tributes while trying to throw in something memorable and urging the public to sponsor them. To demonstrate his strength, Lysistrata sat primly in her chair while Jessup lifted her over his head easily. Io Jasper’s District 3 boy, Circ, said he could start a fire with his glasses, and she, with her scientific know-how, suggested various angles and times of day that would facilitate the task. Snooty Juno Phipps admitted she’d been disappointed to get tiny Bobbin. Didn’t a Phipps, a member of a founding family of the Capitol, deserve better than District 8? But he’d won her over when he told her five different ways he could kill someone with a sewing needle. Coral, Festus’s District 4 girl, made a case for her ability to handle a trident, a weapon that was typically available in the arena. She demonstrated with an old broomstick, wielding it in a sinuous fashion that left little doubt of her expertise. The dairy heiress Domitia Whimsiwick’s familiarity with cows turned out to be an asset. Bubbly by nature, she got her muscular District 10 tribute, Tanner, so engaged in talking about slaughterhouse techniques that Lucky had to cut them off when they ran over. Arachne had been wrong about the appeal of that topic, because Tanner garnered the most applause of the evening so far.

Coriolanus listened with one ear as he prepared to take the stage with Lucy Gray.

His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less.

“It surprised me. You had so many others,” he said.

“I did.” Lucy Gray freed her hand and ran her fingers across the guitar strings, picking out one last bit of melody before she gently settled the instrument back in its case. “Here’s the thing, Coriolanus. I’m going to fight like all-fire to win these Games, but I’m going to be in there with the likes of Reaper and Tanner and a few others who are no strangers to killing.

“The song?” she repeated, and took a moment to consider her answer. “I left some loose ends back in District Twelve. Me being tribute … Well, there’s bad luck and then there’s bad business. That was bad business. And someone who owed me plenty had a hand in it. The song, it was payback of a kind. Most people won’t know that, but the Covey will get the message, loud and clear.

“Well, that could be anything. She’s a performer, after all,” she said.

He considered it. “I suppose.”

“You said she lost her parents. She’s probably been fending for herself for years. I don’t think anyone who survived the war and the years after can blame her for that.” Tigris dropped her gaze. “We all did things we’re not proud of.”

“You didn’t,” he said.

“Didn’t I?” Tigris spoke with an uncharacteristic bitterness. “We all did. Maybe you were too little to remember. Maybe you didn’t know how bad it really was.”

“How can you say that? That’s all I remember,” he shot back.

“Then be kind, Coryo,” she snapped. “And try not to look down on people who had to choose between death and disgrace.”

Tigris’s rebuke shocked him, but less than her alluding to behavior that might be considered a disgrace. What had she done? Because if she’d done it, she’d done it to protect him. He thought about the morning of the reaping, when he’d casually wondered what she had to trade in the black market, but he’d never really taken that seriously. Or hadn’t he? Would he have just preferred not to know what sacrifices she might be willing to make for him?

Tigris smiled. “And you. With your victory garden on the roof.”

He thought about the last couple of weeks, with the bombing in the arena, losing his classmates, Marcus’s escape, and how it all had revived the terror he’d felt when the Capitol had been under siege. What had mattered then, what mattered still, was living without that fear. So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees.

Coriolanus’s classmates had touched on many points that hadn’t crossed his mind. Some had been drawn to the courage of the soldiers, the chance to maybe one day be heroic themselves. Others mentioned the bond that formed between soldiers who fought together, or the nobility of defending the Capitol.

“It felt like we were all part of something bigger,” said Domitia. She nodded solemnly, causing the ponytail on the top of her head to bob. “Something important. We all made sacrifices, but it was to save our country.”

Coriolanus felt disconnected from their “romantic notions,” as he didn’t share a romanticized view of the war. Courage in battle was often necessary because of someone else’s poor planning. He had no idea if he would take a bullet for Festus and had no interest in finding out. As to the noble ideas of the Capitol, did they really believe that? What he desired had little to do with nobility and everything to do with being in control. Not that he didn’t have a strong moral code; certainly he did. But almost everything in war, between its declaration and the victory parades, seemed a waste of resources. He kept one eye on the clock while pretending to be engaged in the conversation, willing time to pass so he wouldn’t have to read anything. The parades seemed shallow, the appeal of power still true but heartless compared to the ramblings of his classmates. And he wished he hadn’t even written the bit about growing the parsley; it just sounded puerile now.

The best he could do, when his time came, was to read the story about the turkey. Domitia told him it was touching, Livia rolled her eyes, and Dr. Gaul raised her eyebrows and asked did he have more to share? He did not.

Sejanus had been silent and subdued through the entire class. He flipped a sheet of paper over and read, “‘The only thing I loved about the war was the fact that I still lived at home.’ If you’re asking me if it had any value beyond that, I would say that it was an opportunity to right some wrongs.”

“And did it?” asked Dr. Gaul.

“Not at all. Things in the districts are worse than ever,” said Sejanus.

Objections came from around the room.

“Whoa!”

“He did not just say that.”

“Go back to Two, then! Who’d miss you?”

He’s really pushing it now, thought Coriolanus. But he was angry, too. It took two parties to make a war. A war that, by the way, the rebels had started. A war that had left him an orphan.

But Sejanus ignored his classmates, staying focused on the Head Gamemaker. “May I ask, what did you love about the war, Dr. Gaul?”

“Like last night Reaper apologized to each of us personally for having to kill us,” she explained. “He says he’ll make it up to us when he wins. He’s going to take revenge on the Capitol, although that part wasn’t as clear as the killing us part.”

Coriolanus’s glance flitted over to Reaper, who was not only powerful but apparently good at mind games. “What was the response to that?”

“Most people just stared at him. Jessup spit in his eye. I told him it wasn’t over until the mockingjay sang, but that only confused him. It’s his way of making sense of all this, I guess. We’re all reeling. It’s not easy … saying good-bye to your life.” Her lower lip began to tremble, and she pushed her sandwich aside without taking so much as a bite."

Are you listening?” She was still crying, but her sobs had quieted to small, intermittent gasps. “My mother left me something when she died. It’s my most precious possession. I want you to have it in the arena, for good luck. It’s a loan, mind you. I fully expect you to return it to me. Otherwise, I could never part with it.” Coriolanus reached into his pocket, extended his hand, and fanned out his fingers. On his palm, gleaming in the last rays of the sun, sat his mother’s silver compact.

Lucy Gray’s mouth dropped open at the sight of it, and she wasn’t easy to impress. She reached out and caressed the exquisitely engraved rose, the antique silver, before drawing back regretfully. “Oh, I couldn’t take it. It’s too fine. It’s enough you offered it, Coriolanus.”

“Are you sure?” he asked, teasing her a bit. He smoothly clicked the latch and held it up so she could see her reflection in the mirror.

Lucy Gray drew in a quick breath and laughed. “Well, now you’re playing on my weakness.” And it was true. She was always so careful with her appearance. Not vain, really. Just conscious. She noticed the empty well where the cake of powder had sat an hour earlier. “Did there used to be powder here?”

“There did, but —” began Coriolanus. He paused. If he said it, there was no going back. On the other hand, if he didn’t, he might be losing her for good. His voice dropped to a whisper. “I thought you might want to use your own.”"

Her eyes darted to the Peacekeepers, none of whom were paying attention, and she leaned in and took a sniff of the compact. “Mm, you can still smell it, though. Lovely.”

“Like roses,” he said.

“Like you,” she said. “It really would be like having you with me, wouldn’t it?”

“Go on,” he urged her. “Take me with you. Take it.”

Lucy Gray wiped away her tears with the back of her hand. “Okay, but it’s a loaner.” She took the compact, slipped it into her pocket, and gave it a pat. “It helps to clarify my thinking. Somehow, winning the Games is just too large a thing to conceive of. But if I say, ‘I need to get this back to Coriolanus,’ I can wrap my mind around that.”

Pleased to have something new, Lucky Flickerman let him run over his allotted time. After filling in the usual details, Coriolanus spent most of the time talking about the Covey and emphasizing that Lucy Gray was not really district, no, not really at all. The Covey had a long history as musical performers, were artists of a kind rarely seen, and were no more like district residents than people from the Capitol were. In fact, if you thought about it, they almost were Capitol, and only by a series of misfortunes had somehow landed, or quite possibly been mistakenly detained, in District 12. Surely people could see how at home Lucy Gray seemed in the Capitol? And Lucky had to agree that yes, yes, there was something special about the girl"

“One look tells you ours have had more food, nicer clothing, and better dental care,” said Dean Highbottom. “Assuming anything more, a physical, mental, or especially a moral superiority, would be a mistake. That sort of hubris almost finished us off in the war.”

“Fascinating,” said Lucky, seemingly for lack of a better response. “Your views are absolutely fascinating.”

“Thank you, Mr. Flickerman. I can think of no one whose opinion I value more,” deadpanned the dean.

Coriolanus thought the dean’s eye roll was implied, but Lucky blushed in response. “That’s very kind, Mr. Highbottom. As we all know, I am only a humble weatherman.”

“And a budding magician,” Dean Highbottom reminded him.

“Well, perhaps I’ll plead guilty to that!” said Lucky with a chortle. “Hold on, what’s this?” He reached behind Dean Highbottom’s ear and pulled out a small, flat candy with bright stripes. “I believe this is yours.” He presented it to Dean Highbottom, the colors smearing his damp palm.

Dean Highbottom made no move to take it. “My goodness. Where did that come from, Lucky?”

“Secrets of the trade,” said Lucky with a knowing grin. “Secrets of the trade.”

In fact, she seemed strangely calm for her circumstances. Without haste, without nervousness, she crossed to the weapons and took her time choosing first a knife, then a small ax, testing each blade for sharpness with the tip of her thumb. She stuck the knife in her belt and swung the ax loosely back and forth, feeling its weight. Then she made her way to one of the poles. Her hand ran down the steel, which was rusty and paint-splattered from some previous job. Coriolanus thought she might try to chop it down, being from the lumber district and all, but instead she secured the ax handle between her teeth and began to climb it, using her knees and calloused feet to grip the metal. It looked natural, like a caterpillar making its way up a stem, but as someone who’d put in extra hours to scale the rope in gym class, he knew the strength it took.

When she reached the top of the post, Lamina regained her feet and slid the ax into her belt. Although the crossbeam couldn’t have measured more than six inches in width, she easily walked along it until she stood above Marcus. Straddling the beam, she locked her ankles for support and leaned over toward his battered head. She said something that the microphones couldn’t pick up, but he must have heard, because his lips moved in response. Lamina sat upright and considered the situation. Then she braced herself again, swung down, and drove the ax blade into the curved side of Marcus’s neck. Once. Twice. And on the third time, in a spray of blood, she succeeded in killing him. Regaining her seat, she wiped her hands clean on her skirt and stared off into the arena.

“That’s my girl!” Pup cried out. Suddenly, he appeared on the screen as the Heavensbee Hall camera streamed his reaction. Coriolanus caught a glimpse of himself a couple of rows behind Pup and sat up straighter. Pup grinned, revealing bits of his morning eggs in his braces, and gave a fist pump. “First kill of the day! That’s my tribute, Lamina, from District Seven,” he said to the camera. He held up his wrist. “And my communicuff is open for business. Never too late to show your support and send a gift!”

The phone number flashed on the screen again, and Coriolanus could hear a few faint pings coming from Pup’s communicuff as Lamina received some sponsor gifts. The Hunger Games felt more fluid, more changeful than he had prepared for. Wake up! he told himself. You’re not a spectator, you’re a mentor!

“Thank you!” Pup waved at the camera. “Well, I think she deserves a little something, don’t you?” He fiddled with the communicuff and looked up at the screen expectantly as the camera jumped back to Lamina. The audience watched with anticipation, as this would be the first attempt to deliver a gift to a tribute. A minute passed, then five. Coriolanus had begun to wonder if the technology had failed the Gamemakers, when a small drone clutching a pint-sized bottle of water in its claws appeared over the top of the arena by the entrance and made its way shakily to Lamina. It looped and dipped and even reversed course before crashing into the crossbeam a good ten feet from her and falling to the ground like a swatted insect. The bottle had cracked, so the water soaked into the dirt and vanished.

“I don’t know if I can,” she said. “Him so upset and all. I can try, but he’ll have to think it’s the right thing to do.”

The right thing to do. Coriolanus realized that this was what had always defined Sejanus’s actions, his determination to do the right thing. That insistence, the way, for instance, he would defy Dr. Gaul when the rest of them were just trying to get by, was another reason he alienated people.

Another student, or even the Coriolanus of a couple of weeks ago, would have protested this situation. Insisted on calling a parent or guardian. Pleaded. But after the snake attack on Clemensia, the aftermath of the bombing, and Marcus’s torture, he knew it would be pointless. If Dr. Gaul decided he was to go into the Capitol Arena, that’s where he would go, even if his prize was not at stake.

“Terrifying,” said Coriolanus flatly.

“It’s designed to be.” She checked his pupils, shining a light into each of his eyes. “What about the tributes?”

The light hurt his head. “What about them?”

Dr. Gaul moved on to his stitches. “What did you think of them, now that their chains have been removed? Now that they’ve tried to kill you? Because it was of no benefit to them, your death. You’re not the competition.”

It was true. They’d been close enough to recognize him. But they’d hunted down him and Sejanus — Sejanus, who’d treated the tributes so well, fed them, defended them, given them last rites! — even though they could have used that opportunity to kill one another.

“I think I underestimated how much they hate us,” said Coriolanus.

“And when you realized that, what was your response?” she asked.

He thought back to Bobbin, to the escape, to the tributes’ bloodlust even after he’d cleared the bars. “I wanted them dead. I wanted every one of them dead.”

Dr. Gaul nodded. “Well, mission accomplished with that little one from Eight. You beat him to a pulp. Have to make up some story for that buffoon Flickerman to tell in the morning. But what a wonderful opportunity for you. Transformative.”

“Was it?” Coriolanus remembered the sickening thuds of his board against Bobbin. So he had what? Murdered the boy? No, not that. It was an open-and-shut case of self-defense. But what, then? He had killed him, certainly. There would never be any erasing that. No regaining that innocence. He had taken human life.

“Wasn’t it? More than I could’ve hoped. I needed you to get Sejanus out of the arena, of course, but I wanted you to taste that as well,” she said.

The idea, laid out as such, shocked him, but he attempted a laugh. “Are we really as bad as all that?”

Clemensia had once told Coriolanus it was the only revenge she could take on her father, but refused to give any more details.

True to form, Iphigenia began to unload every bit of food she could on her tribute, but even as the drones made the long trek across the arena, Mizzen, Coral, and Tanner, who appeared to have formed some sort of pack after the previous night’s adventure, materialized from the tunnels and began their hunt. After a brief chase along the bleachers, the trio surrounded the girl, and Coral killed her with a trident to the throat.

“Well, that’s that,” said Lucky, still unable to locate the tribute’s name. “What can her mentor tell us, Lepidus?”

Iphigenia had already sought out Lepidus. “Her name was Sol, or maybe Sal. She had a funny accent. Not much more to tell.”

They created a strange tableau: rabid boy, trapped girl, bombed-out building. It suggested a tale that could only end in tragedy. Star-crossed lovers meeting their fate. A revenge story turned in on itself. A war saga that took no prisoners.

Please die, Coriolanus thought. What eventually killed you when you had rabies? You couldn’t breathe, or maybe your heart stopped? Whatever it was, the sooner it happened to Jessup, the better it was for everyone involved.

A drone carrying a bottle of water flew into the arena, and Lucy Gray lifted her face to track its wobbly progress. Her tongue flicked across her lips as if in anticipation. However, as it passed over Jessup’s head, something registered and a shudder racked his body. He swung at it with a board, and the drone crashed into the stands. The water pooling out of the cracked bottle sent him into a state of heightened agitation. He backed away, tripping over the seats, and then made straight for Lucy Gray. She, in turn, began to climb even higher.

Coriolanus panicked. While the strategy of putting the wreckage between herself and Jessup had some merit, she was in danger of being cut off from the field. The virus may have compromised Jessup’s movement, but it also loaned a manic speed to his powerful body, and nothing distracted him from Lucy Gray. Except that moment with the water, he thought. The water. A word surfaced in his brain. A word from the poster that had papered the Capitol for a time. Hydrophobia. A fear of water. The inability to swallow made rabies victims go wild at the sight of it.

His fingers began to work his communicuff, to order bottles of water. Perhaps enough of them would frighten Jessup away. He would drain his bank if he had to.

Lysistrata placed her hand on his, stopping him. “No, let me. He’s my tribute, after all.” She began to order bottle after bottle. Sending in the water to drive Jessup over the brink. Her face registered little emotion, but a single tear slid down her cheek, just kissing the edge of her mouth before she brushed it away.

“Lyssie …” He hadn’t called her that since they were tiny. “You don’t have to.”

“If Jessup can’t win, I want Lucy Gray to. That’s what he’d want. And she can’t win if he kills her,” she said. “Which might happen anyway.”

On-screen, Coriolanus could see that Lucy Gray had indeed worked herself into a tough spot. To her left stood the high back wall of the arena, to her right the thick glass side of the press box. As Jessup continued his pursuit, she made several attempts to escape him, but he kept correcting his course to block her. When he came within twenty feet, she began to talk to him, putting her hand out in a soothing manner. It stopped him, but only momentarily, and he made for her again.

Far across the arena, the first bottle of Lysistrata’s water, or perhaps the replacement for the one that had crashed, began its flight toward the tributes. This machine seemed steadier and truer in course, as did the small fleet that followed it. The moment Lucy Gray spied the drones she stopped her retreat. Coriolanus saw her hand pat the ruffles of her skirt over the pocket with the silver compact, and he took it as a sign that she had grasped the significance of the water. She pointed over at the drones, beginning to shout, and succeeded in getting Jessup to turn his head.

Coriolanus could barely hear Lysistrata whisper, “Oh, don’t let him die alone.”

Weighing the danger, Lucy Gray took a moment to assess the empty arena before she picked her way down the broken wall to his side. Coriolanus wanted to groan — she needed to get out of there — but he couldn’t do it with Lysistrata beside him. “She won’t,” he reassured Lysistrata, thinking of how Lucy Gray had dragged the burning beam from his body. “It’s not her style.”

“I’ve got some money left,” said Lysistrata, wiping her eyes. “I’ll send some food.”

Jessup followed Lucy Gray with his eyes as she jumped the last yard to the field, but he seemed unable to move. Was he paralyzed by the fall? She approached him with caution and knelt just out of reach of his long arms. Trying to smile, she said, “You go to sleep now, you hear, Jessup? You go on, it’s my turn to stand guard.” Something seemed to register, her voice or perhaps the repetition of words she’d spoken to him over the past two weeks. The rigidity eased in his face, and his eyelids fluttered. “That’s right. Let yourself go. How are you going to dream if you don’t go to sleep?” Lucy Gray scooted forward and laid a hand on his head. “It’s okay. I’ll watch over you. I’m right here.

She heaved a deep sigh, and Coriolanus could feel her exhaustion. She shook her head as if to wake herself, then grabbed the nearest bottle of water, twisting off the top and draining it in a few gulps. A second followed, then a third, before she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She stood up and examined Jessup, then opened another bottle and poured it over his face, washing away the foam and spittle. From her pocket she took the white linen napkin that had lined the picnic box Coriolanus brought her the final night. She leaned down and used the edge to gently shut his eyelids, then shook out the cloth and covered his face to hide it from the audience.

The food parcels from Lysistrata thumping down around her seemed to bring Lucy Gray back to the moment, and she quickly scooped up the pieces of bread and cheese and stuffed them in her pockets. She gathered the bottles of water in her skirt, but pulled up short as Reaper appeared at the far end of the arena. Lucy Gray lost no time in vanishing into the nearest tunnel with her gifts. Reaper let her go but walked over to collect the last few water bottles in the fading light, taking note of Jessup but leaving his body alone.

Coriolanus thought it might bode well for later. If the tributes kept making a habit of scavenging the gifts of the fallen, they’d play right into the poisoning plan. He didn’t have much time to dwell on it, though, as Lepidus arrived to claim Lysistrata.

“Whoa!” Lepidus said. “That was unexpected! Did you know about the rabies?”

“Of course not. I would’ve alerted the authorities so they could test the raccoons in the zoo,” she said.

“What? You mean he didn’t bring it from the districts?” said Lepidus.

Lysistrata was firm. “No, he was bitten here in the Capitol.”

“At the zoo?” Lepidus looked worried. “A lot of us have been spending time at the zoo. A raccoon was over by my equipment, you know, scratching around with those weird little hands and —”

“You don’t have rabies,” Lysistrata said flatly.

Lepidus made a clawing motion with his fingers. “It was touching my things.”

“Did you have any questions about Jessup?” she asked.

“Jessup? No, I never got near him. Oh, um, you meant … Did you have any thoughts?” he asked.

“I do.” She took a deep breath. “What I’d like people to know about Jessup is that he was a good person. He threw his body over mine to protect me when the bombs started going off in the arena. It wasn’t even conscious. He did it reflexively. That’s who he was at heart. A protector. I don’t think he would’ve ever won the Games, because he’d have died trying to protect Lucy Gray.”

“Oh, like a dog or something.” Lepidus nodded. “A really good one.”

“No, not like a dog. Like a human being,” said Lysistrata.

Lepidus eyed her, trying to decipher whether she was joking. “Huh. Lucky, any thoughts from headquarters?”

Most popular? It was flattering, Coriolanus supposed, but not especially intimidating. Never mind, though. Popular had gotten Lucy Gray a pile of money. She was alive, watered, fed, and well stocked. Hopefully, she could hole up while the others thinned their ranks. Losing Jessup as her protector was a blow, but it would be easier for her to hide by herself.

It wasn’t an official alliance, but the exchange seemed to bond the two a bit. While Lamina shook out the flag and draped it over her head, Reaper sat against one of the posts and ate his bread and cheese.

“Exactly right. Now the audience is an active player in the Games.” Dean Highbottom inclined his head toward Lucky. “And you know what that means.”

The dean spoke the next words slowly, as if to a small child. “It means we’re all in the arena together, Lucky.”

Lucky furrowed his brow. “Huh. I don’t quite get that.”

Dean Highbottom tapped his temple with his forefinger. “Think it over.”

At least she could hide from those. He didn’t know for sure, but he was guessing the snakes would head straight for the tunnels. The dark would not impair their sense of smell. They would not recognize Lucy Gray’s scent, just the way they had not recognized Clemensia’s. Lucy Gray would scream and fall to the ground, her lips turning purple, then bloodless, while bright pink and blue and yellow pus oozed onto her ruffled dress — That was it! The thing the snakes had reminded him of the first time he’d seen them. They matched her dress. As if they had always been her destiny …

Without knowing quite how, Coriolanus found the handkerchief in his hand, neatly balled up like a prop in one of Lucky’s magic tricks. He moved to the snake tank, his back to the security camera, and leaned over, resting his hands on the cover as if fascinated by the snakes. From that vantage point, he watched the handkerchief fall through the trapdoor and disappear beneath the rainbow of bodies."

Sejanus, it seemed, had gone to bed early, and he’d caught her in the kitchen. Would he come downstairs for a moment and have a cup of tea? Or perhaps she should serve tea in here, like the Snows had. No, no, he assured her, the kitchen would be fine. As if anyone served a guest in the kitchen but a Plinth. But he had not come to pass judgment. He had come to be thanked, and if that involved baked goods, all the better.

“Would you like pie? I’ve got blackberry. Or peach if you can wait for it.” She nodded to a pair of newly assembled pies on the counter awaiting the oven. “Or maybe cake? I made custards this afternoon. The Avoxes like those best, because, you know, they’re easy to swallow. Coffee or tea or milk?” The lines between Ma’s eyebrows deepened in anxiety, as if nothing she could offer would be good enough."

She carved out a full quarter of the pie and plunked it onto a plate. “Do you like ice cream?” she asked. Several scoops of vanilla followed.

She’s the only one I really stay in touch with now. Or who stays in touch with me, I guess. Doesn’t really fit with the rest of the house, but I have my corner down here. Please, sit. Eat.”

Her corner boasted the table with three mismatched chairs, the needlepoint, and a shelf filled with little oddities. A pair of rooster salt and pepper shakers, a marble egg, and a soft doll with patched clothing. The sum total of the possessions, Coriolanus suspected, that she’d brought from home. Her shrine to District 2. It was pitiful, the way she clung to that backward mountain region.

“For any of us Plinths, really. Strabo says that while it’s hard for us now, it will be better for Sejanus and his children, but I don’t know.” She glanced up at her shelf. “Your family and friends, that’s your real life, Coriolanus, and we left all ours back in Two. But you know that already. I can see it. I’m glad you’ve got your grandma and that sweet cousin.”

Coriolanus found himself trying to cheer her up, saying that things would be better once Sejanus graduated from the Academy. The University had more people, and more kinds of people from all over the Capitol, and he was sure to make new friends.

Mrs. Plinth nodded but didn’t seem convinced. The Avox maid caught her attention and communicated in a kind of sign language. “All right, he’ll come up after he finishes his pie,” Mrs. Plinth told her. “My husband would like to see you, if you don’t mind. I think he wants to thank you."

The man stood at a fancy stone fireplace, his tall frame propped up by an elbow on the mantel, staring down into where the flame would be in another season. Now the hearth was cold and empty, and Coriolanus had to wonder what he saw there that would provoke the profoundly sad expression on his face. One hand gripped the velvet lapel of his expensive smoking jacket, which seemed all wrong, like Mrs. Plinth’s designer dress or Sejanus’s suit.

Sit.” Mr. Plinth gestured to the leather chairs before the fireplace rather than the ones before his imposing oak desk. This was to be personal, then, not business. “You’ve eaten? Of course, you couldn’t get out of the kitchen without my wife stuffing you like a turkey. Do you want a drink? A whiskey maybe?”

Adults had never offered him any beverage stronger than posca, which went quickly enough to his head. He couldn’t risk that for this exchange. “I don’t know where I’d put it,” he said with a laugh, patting his stomach as he settled himself into a chair. “But please, you go ahead.”

“Oh, I don’t drink.” Mr. Plinth folded himself into the facing chair and looked Coriolanus over. “You look like your father.”

“I hear that a lot,” said Coriolanus. “Did you know him?”

“Our business overlapped at times.” He drummed his long fingers on the arm of the chair. “It’s striking, the resemblance. But you’re nothing like him, really.”

No, thought Coriolanus. I’m poor and powerless. Although maybe the perceived difference was good for tonight’s purposes. His district-hating father would have loathed seeing Strabo Plinth admitted to the Capitol and becoming a titan of the munitions industry. That was not why he’d given his life in the war.

“Nothing at all. Or you’d never have gone into that arena after my son,” continued Mr. Plinth. “Impossible to imagine Crassus Snow risking his life for me. I keep asking myself why you did it.”

Not much choice, really, thought Coriolanus. “He’s my friend,” he said.

“No matter how many times I hear that, it’s difficult to believe. But even from the beginning, Sejanus singled you out. Maybe you take after your mother, huh? She was always gracious to me when I came here on business before the war. Despite my background. The very definition of a lady. Never forgot it.” He gave Coriolanus a hard stare. “Are you like your mother?”

Chaos, control, and what was the third? Oh, yes. Contract. What happened if no one was in control of humanity? That was the topic he was supposed to address. And he had said there was chaos. And Dr. Gaul had said to start there.

Chaos. Extreme disorder and confusion. “Like being in the arena,” Dr. Gaul had said. That “wonderful opportunity,” she had called it. “Transformative.” Coriolanus thought about what it had felt like to be in the arena, where there were no rules, no laws, no consequences to one’s actions. The needle of his moral compass had swung madly without direction. Fueled by the terror of being prey, how quickly he himself had become a predator, with no reservations about smashing Bobbin to death. He’d transformed, all right, but not into anything he was proud of — and being a Snow, he had more self-control than most. He tried to imagine what it would be like if the whole world played by those same rules. No consequences. People taking what they wanted, when they wanted, and killing for it if it came to that. Survival driving everything. There had been days during the war when they’d all been too scared to leave the apartment. Days when the lawlessness had made even the Capitol an arena.

Yes, the lack of law, that was at the heart of it. So people needed to agree on laws to follow. Was that what Dr. Gaul had meant by “social contract”? The agreement not to rob, abuse, or kill one another? It had to be. And the law required enforcement, and that was where control came in. Without the control to enforce the contract, chaos reigned. The power that controlled needed to be greater than the people — otherwise, they would challenge it. The only entity capable of this was the Capitol.

Clemensia went rigid but silent.

Her grip on the pole began to fail, and she cried out to Mizzen for help, but he only shook his head, more stunned than malicious.

People in the audience began shushing each other then, although Coriolanus did not know why. As the hall quieted, he picked up on what sharper ears had detected. Somewhere, ever so faintly, someone was singing in the arena.

His girl.

Lucy Gray emerged from her tunnel moving in slow motion, and backward. She lifted each foot with care as she stepped behind herself, swaying gently to the rhythm of her music.

La, la, la, la,La, la, la, la, la, la,La, la, la, la, la, la …

That was the extent of the lyrics at the moment, but it was compelling nonetheless. Following her, as if mesmerized by the melody, came half a dozen snakes.

Coriolanus released Clemensia, who had calmed down, giving her a gentle push in Festus’s direction. He stepped toward the screen, holding his breath as Lucy Gray continued to back in and then curve around toward where Jessup’s body had lain. Her voice became louder as she, knowingly or not, worked her way back to the mic. Perhaps for one last song, one last performance.

None of the snakes were inclined to attack her, though. In fact, she seemed to be drawing them from around the arena. The bunch under Teslee’s pole thinned, a few dropped from the stands, and dozens slithered out of the tunnels to join in a general migration to Lucy Gray. They surrounded her, flocking in from all sides, making it impossible for her to continue retreating. The bright bodies undulated over her bare feet, curling around her ankles as she lowered herself gently onto a chunk of marble.

With the tips of her fingers, she spread her ruffles out in the dust, as if by way of invitation. As the snakes swarmed her, the faded fabric vanished, leaving her with a brilliant skirt of weaving reptiles"

No one except Vipsania had thought to bring bedding, so the rest arranged themselves in the padded chairs, propping up their feet and using book bags as makeshift pillows. As the rainy night cooled the hall, Coriolanus dozed in his chair, one eye half-open for any activity on the screen. The storm obscured all, and eventually he drifted off. Near dawn, he woke with a start and looked around. Vipsania, Urban, and Persephone slept soundly. From a few yards away, Clemensia’s large dark eyes shone in the dim light.

He did not want to be her enemy. If the Snow fortress was about to fall, he would need friends. Until the snake incident, he’d counted Clemensia among his best. And she’d always gotten on well with Tigris, too. But how to make amends?

Clemensia had one hand tucked inside her shirt, where she fingered the collarbone she’d presented in the hospital. The one covered in scales.

“Did they go away?” he whispered.

Clemensia tensed. “They’re fading. Finally. They said it may take as long as a year.”

“Are they painful?” It was the first time the idea had occurred to him.

“Not painful. They pull. On my skin.” She rubbed the scales. “It’s hard to explain.”

Heartened by the confidence, he took the plunge. “I’m sorry, Clemmie. Really. About all of it.”

“You didn’t know what she had planned,” said Clemensia.

“No, I didn’t. But after, in the hospital, I should’ve been there for you. I should’ve broken down the doors to make sure you were okay,” he insisted.

“Yes!” she said emphatically, but she seemed to relent a little. “But I know you were hurt, too. In the arena.”

“Oh, don’t make excuses for me.” He threw up his hands. “I’m worthless and we both know it!”

A hint of a smile. “Almost. I guess I should thank you for keeping me from making a complete fool of myself today.”

“Did I?” He squinted as if trying to recall. “All I remember is clinging to you. Not necessarily hiding behind you. But there was definitely clinging.”

She laughed a little but then became serious. “I shouldn’t have blamed so much on you. I’m sorry. I was terrified.”

“With good reason. I wish you hadn’t had to watch that today,” he said.

“Maybe it was cathartic. I feel better somehow,” she confessed. “Am I terrible?”

“No,” he said. “The only thing you are is brave.”

Since it seemed out of their control, they abandoned it. The two would pair up together or they would not.

“At least we’re allies again,” he said.

“Well, not enemies anyway,” Clemensia allowed. But when they went to wash their faces for the cameras, she loaned him her soap so he wouldn’t have to use the abrasive liquid goop in the bathrooms, and somehow the small but intimate gesture let him know he was forgiven."

She surveyed the arena and, judging it safe, stepped into the sunlight. The mud on the hem of her ruffled skirt had begun to cake, but the damp dress still clung to her. While Coriolanus ordered her a feast on his communicuff, Lucy Gray crossed to Reaper’s puddle and knelt. She scooped up water, slaking her thirst and washing her face. After combing out her hair with her fingers, she twisted it into a loose knot, finishing just as a dozen drones entered the arena.

She appeared not to notice them as she took a bottle from her pocket and dipped the neck into the puddle, collecting an inch or so of water. After swishing it around, Lucy Gray poured the water back into the puddle and was making to refill the bottle when the incoming drones caught her attention. As the food and water began to drop around her, she tossed away the old bottle and gathered her gifts into her skirt.

Lucy Gray started for the nearest tunnel but then glanced up at Reaper lolling in the stands. She changed course, hurried to his morgue, and lifted the flag material. Her lips moved as she counted the fallen.

“She’s trying to figure out who’s left in the Games,” Coriolanus said into the mic that Lepidus had pushed in his face."

Reaper staggered a bit, as though drunk. Flag in tow, he made his way to his puddle, one of the few that hadn’t dried up during the afternoon. He dropped down on his knees and drank, slurping until only a muddy sludge remained on the bottom. As he sat back on his heels, a funny look crossed his face, and his fingers began to knead his ribs and chest. He vomited up a portion of the water, then retched for a while on his hands and knees before rising unsteadily. Still gripping the flag in one hand, he began to walk, in slow, uneven steps, back toward his morgue. Reaper had just made it when he collapsed on the ground, dragging himself in line next to Treech. One hand made an attempt to pull the flag over the group, but he managed only to cover himself partway before he drew in his limbs and went still.

Coriolanus sat frozen in anticipation. Was that it? Had he really won? The Hunger Games? The Plinth Prize? The girl? He studied Lucy Gray’s face as she watched Reaper from the stands, but she had a distant look, as if she were far away from the action in the arena"

Oh, Snow lands on top; it most certainly does. He forced his cheeks to relax as he got to the door, and straightened his jacket to help conceal the tipsy mess he actually was. It wouldn’t do, somehow, to let Dr. Gaul see him like that.

When he opened the door to the high biology lab, he found only Dean Highbottom, sitting in his usual place at the table. “Close the door behind you.” Coriolanus obliged. Perhaps the dean wanted to congratulate him in private. Or even apologize for abusing him. A falling star might one day have need of a rising one. But as he approached the dean, a cold dread washed over him. There, arranged on the table like lab specimens, were three items: an Academy napkin stained with grape punch, his mother’s silver compact, and a dingy white handkerchief.

“Oh, don’t blame her. The Peacekeepers had to wrestle her to the ground to get the thing. Naturally, we do a thorough search of the victors when they leave the arena.” The dean cocked his head and smiled. “So smart about how she poisoned Wovey and Reaper. Not really fair play, but what’s to be done? Sending her back to District Twelve seems punishment enough. She said the rat poison was all her idea, that the compact had just been a token.”

“It’s true,” said Coriolanus. “It was. A token of my affection. I don’t know anything about any poison.”

“Let’s say I believe you, which I don’t. But let’s say I do. What, then, am I to make of this?” Dean Highbottom lifted the handkerchief with the tip of the pen. “One of the lab assistants found it in the snake tank yesterday morning. Everyone was baffled at first, checking their pockets to see if their own hankies had gone astray, because who else had been near the mutts? One young fellow actually claimed it, saying his allergies had been particularly bad and that he’d misplaced his handkerchief only a few days before. But just as he was offering his resignation, someone noticed the initials. Not yours. Your father’s. So delicately stitched in the corner.”

CXS. Stitched in the same white thread as the border. Part of the border pattern, really, so unassuming that you’d have to look carefully for it, but irrefutably there. Coriolanus never bothered to examine his daily handkerchief; he just stuffed one in his pocket as he headed out.

He felt sure he was having a heart attack but made no attempt to call for help, instead curling into a ball and pressing his face against the wall. Perhaps it was for the best. Because there was no out. Nowhere to run. No hope of rescue. No future that was not a living death. What did he have to look forward to? Hash? A weekly cup of gin? A promotion from dish washing to dish scraping? Wasn’t it better to die now, quickly, than to drag it out painfully for years?

Somewhere — it seemed very distant — he heard a door bang shut. Footsteps came down the hall, pausing for a minute and then continuing toward him. He gritted his teeth, willing his heart to stop at once, because the world and he had finished with each other and it was time to part ways. But the footsteps grew louder and came to a halt at his door. Was the person looking at him? Was it the patrol? Staring at him in this mortifying position? Lapping up his wretchedness? He waited for the laughter, the derision, and the latrine duty that was sure to follow.

Instead he heard a quiet voice say, “Is this bunk taken?” A quiet and familiar voice …

Coriolanus twisted around on the bed, his eyes flying open to confirm what his ears already knew. Standing in the doorway, looking oddly at home in a set of fatigues still creased from the package, stood Sejanus Plinth."

“Hm. Let’s see. Having defied the Capitol by entering the arena, I, too, was on the verge of expulsion. My father went before the board and said he’d pay for a new gymnasium for the Academy if they would let me graduate and sign up for the Peacekeepers. They agreed, but I said I wouldn’t take the deal unless they’d let you graduate, too. Well, Professor Sickle really wanted a new gym, and she said what did it matter if we were both tied up for the next twenty years anyway?” Sejanus set his duffel on the floor and dug out his box of personal items.

“I got to graduate?” said Coriolanus.

Sejanus opened the box, removed a small leather folder with the school’s emblem, and held it out with great ceremony. “Congratulations. You are no longer a dropout.”

Coriolanus flipped open the cover and found a diploma with his name inscribed in curlicues. The thing must have been written out in advance, because it even credited him with High Honors. “Thank you. I guess it’s stupid, but it still matters to me.”

“You know, if you ever wanted to take the officer candidate test, it might matter. You need to have graduated secondary school. Dean Highbottom brought that up as something that should be denied you. He said you broke some rule in the Games to help Lucy Gray? Anyway, he got outvoted.” Sejanus chuckled. “He’s really wearing on people.”

“So I’m not universally reviled?” said Coriolanus.

“For what? Falling in love? I think more people pity you. A lot of romantics among our teachers, come to find out,” said Sejanus. “And Lucy Gray made quite a good impression.”

“By the next morning, there was no mention of it,” said Sejanus. “When I went into the Academy for my review, I heard some of the faculty talking about what a mistake it’d been to involve the students, so I think that was a one-off. But I wouldn’t be surprised if we see Lucky Flickerman back again next year, or the post office open for gifts and betting.”

“Our legacy,” said Coriolanus.

“So it seems,” said Sejanus. “Satyria told Professor Sickle that Dr. Gaul is determined to keep it going somehow. A part of her eternal war, I guess. Instead of battles, we have the Hunger Games.”

“Yes, to punish the districts and remind us what beasts we are,” said Coriolanus, focused on lining up Sejanus’s folded socks in the locker.

“What?” asked Sejanus, giving him a funny look.

“I don’t know,” said Coriolanus. “It’s like … you know how she’s always torturing that rabbit or melting the flesh off something?”

“Like she enjoys it?” asked Sejanus.

“Exactly. I think that’s how she thinks we all are. Natural-born killers. Inherently violent,” Coriolanus said. “The Hunger Games are a reminder of what monsters we are and how we need the Capitol to keep us from chaos.”

“So, not only is the world a brutal place, but people enjoy its brutality? Like the essay on everything we loved about the war,” said Sejanus. “As if it had been some big show.” He shook his head. “So much for not thinking.”

“Forget it,” said Coriolanus. “Let’s just be happy that she’s out of our lives.”

As the truck drove around the perimeter of the district, the buildings went from dingy to squalid. The doors and windows of the decrepit houses gaped in the heat. Hollow-faced women sat on doorsteps, watching half-naked children with sharp rib cages playing listlessly in the dirt. In some yards, pumps attested to the lack of running water, and the sagging power lines suggested that electricity was not guaranteed.

It frightened Coriolanus, this level of want. He’d been broke most of his life, but the Snows had always worked hard to maintain decency. These people had given up, and some part of him blamed them for their plight. He shook his head. “We pour so much money into the districts,” he said. It must be true. People always complained about it in the Capitol.

“We pour money into our industries, not into the districts themselves,” said Sejanus. “The people are on their own.”

She gave one last wail of despair, and the birds picked that up as well, first as a voice and then as part of the arrangement. Human speech had vanished, and what remained was a musical chorus of Arlo and Lil’s exchange.

“Mockingjays,” grumbled a soldier in front of him. “Stinking mutts.”

Coriolanus remembered talking to Lucy Gray before the interview.

“Well, you know what they say. The show’s not over until the mockingjay sings.”

“The mockingjay? Really, I think you’re just making these things up.”

“Not that one. A mockingjay’s a bona fide bird.”

“And it sings in your show?”

“Not my show, sweetheart. Yours. The Capitol’s anyway.”

This must be what she’d meant. The Capitol’s show was the hanging. The mockingjay some sort of bona fide bird. Not a jabberjay. Different somehow. A regional thing, he supposed. But that was strange, because the soldier had called them mutts. His eyes strained to try and isolate one in the foliage. Now that he knew what he was looking for, he found several jabberjays. Perhaps the mockingjays were identical … but no, wait, there! A little higher up. A black bird, slightly larger than the jabberjays, suddenly opened its wings to reveal two patches of dazzling white as it lifted its beak in song. Coriolanus felt sure he’d spotted his first mockingjay, and he disliked the thing on sight.

The birdsong unsettled the audience, and whispers turned to mutters, which turned to objections as the Peacekeepers shoved Lil into the van that had brought Arlo. Coriolanus felt afraid of this mob’s potential. Were they about to turn on the soldiers? Unbidden, he felt his thumb release the safety on his gun.

“I thought I could be a medic,” confessed Sejanus.

“A medic,” Coriolanus repeated. “Like a doctor?”

“No, that would require university training,” Sejanus explained. “Something more basic. Something where I could help anyone who’d been injured, Capitol or district, when violence breaks out. At least I wouldn’t do any harm. I just don’t know if I could ever kill anyone, Coryo.”

Coriolanus felt a stab of annoyance. Had Sejanus forgotten that it was his own reckless behavior that had led to Coriolanus killing Bobbin? That his selfishness had robbed his friend of the luxury of such a statement? Then he suppressed a laugh at the thought of old Strabo Plinth. A munitions giant with a pacifist heir. He could imagine the conversations that had transpired between father and son. What a waste, he thought. What a waste of a dynasty.

“What about in a war?” he asked Sejanus. “You’re a soldier, you know.”

“I know. A war would be different, I guess,” said Sejanus. “But I would have to be fighting for something I believed in. I would have to believe it would make the world a better place. I’d still rather be a medic, but there isn’t much demand for them at the moment, it turns out. Without a war. They’ve got a long waiting list of people who’d like to be trained to work at the clinic. But even for that, you need a recommendation, and the sergeant doesn’t want to give me one.”

“Why not? Sounds like a perfect fit,” said Coriolanus.

“Because I’m too good with a gun,” Sejanus told him. “It’s true. I’m a crack shot. My father taught me from when I was tiny, and every week I had mandatory target practice. He considers it part of the family business.”

Coriolanus tried to process the information. “Why didn’t you hide it?”

“I thought I was. In reality, I shoot much better than I do in training. I tried not to stand out, but the rest of the squad is terrible.” Sejanus caught himself. “Not you.”

“Yes, me.” Coriolanus laughed. “Look, I think you’re making too much of this. It’s not like we have a hanging every day. And if it ever did come to it, just shoot to miss.”

But the words only fueled Sejanus. “And what if that means you, or Beanpole, or Smiley, end up dead? Because I didn’t protect you?”

“Oh, Sejanus!” Coriolanus burst out in exasperation. “You have to stop overthinking everything! Imagining every worst-case scenario. That isn’t going to happen. We’re all going to die right here, of old age or excessive mopping, whatever takes us first. In the meantime, quit hitting the target! Or invent a problem with your eyes! Or smash your hand in the door!”

“Stop being so self-indulgent, in other words,” said Sejanus.

“Well, so dramatic anyway. That’s how you ended up in the arena, remember?” asked Coriolanus.

A fist caught Coriolanus’s mouth, sending his own fists into action. He struck out arbitrarily, focused only on securing his own circle of safety. The same animal wildness he’d experienced when the tributes had hunted him down in the arena swept over him. Dr. Gaul’s voice echoed in his ears. “That’s mankind in its natural state. That’s humanity undressed.” And here was naked humanity again, and here again he was a part of it. Punching, kicking, his teeth bared in the darkness.

Passion, music, liquor, moonlight, and a wild boy who embraced them all? Not a perspiring Peacekeeper showing up at her door on a Sunday morning with a split lip and a sagging bag of ice.

He gave over the lead to Sejanus, following him up and down cinder paths without comment. Eventually, his companion would grow tired, and they could go back and catch up on their letter writing. Sejanus, Tigris, his friends, the faculty, all of them had been dead wrong about him. He’d never been motivated by love or ambition, only a desire to get his prize and a nice, quiet bureaucratic job pushing papers around and leaving him plenty of time to attend tea parties.

So Lucy Gray didn’t have a monopoly on the strange manner of talking. It must be a Covey thing. “A lost soul?” asked Coriolanus.

“Sure. The Covey found Tam Amber when he was just a baby. Somebody left him in a cardboard box on the side of the road, so he’s ours. Joke’s on them, too, because he’s the finest picker alive,” Maude Ivory declared. “Not much of a talker, though. Is that ice?”

Coriolanus swung the diminishing clump of cubes. “What’s left of it.”

“Oh, Lucy Gray will like that. We’ve got a fridge, but the freezer’s long broke,” said Maude Ivory. “Seems fancy to have ice in summertime. Like flowers in wintertime. Rare.”

Coriolanus agreed. “My grandmother grows roses in winter. People make a big fuss over them.”

“Lucy Gray said you smelled like roses,” said Maude Ivory. “Is your whole house full of them?”

“She grows them on the roof,” Coriolanus told her.

She sprang from the rock, twisting her body as she rose, her eyes wide with fear and the guitar held out as if to block a blow. For a moment, he thought she’d flee, but her alarm shifted to relief at the sight of him. She shook her head, as close as he’d ever seen her to embarrassed, as she propped her guitar against the rock. “Sorry. Still got one foot in the arena.”

If his brief foray in the Games had left him nervous and nightmarish, he could only imagine how damaged she was. The last month had upended their lives and changed them irrevocably. Sad, really, as they were both rather exceptional people, for whom the world had reserved its harshest treatment.

“Yes, it leaves quite an impression,” he said. They stood for a moment, drinking each other in, before they moved together. The bag of ice slid from his hand as she wrapped her arms around him, melting her body into his. He locked her in an embrace, remembering how scared he’d been for her, for himself, and how he hadn’t dared fantasize about this moment as it had seemed so unattainable.

With the water, and the food, and believe me, taking out Bobbin was major, even though I know it must have been awful for you. It sure was for me.” Lucy Gray admitted to three of her own kills. First Wovey, although that had not been targeted. She’d merely positioned a bottle of water with a few swallows and a bit of powder as if it had been dropped accidentally in the tunnels, and Wovey had been the one to find it. “I was gunning for Coral.” She claimed Reaper, whose puddle she’d poisoned, had contracted rabies when Jessup spat in his eye in the zoo. “So that was really a mercy killing. I spared him what Jessup went through. And taking out Treech with that viper was self-defense. Still not sure why those snakes loved me so. Not convinced it was my singing. Snakes don’t even hear well.”

So he told her. About the lab, and Clemensia, and Dr. Gaul’s plan to release the snakes into the arena, and how he’d secretly dropped his handkerchief, his father’s handkerchief, into the tank so they could become accustomed to her scent. “But they found it, loaded with DNA from both of us.”

“And that’s why you’re here? Not the rat poison in the compact?” she asked.

“Yes,” he said. “You covered beautifully for me on that one.”

“Did my best.” She considered things for a minute. “Well, that’s it, then. I saved you from the fire, and you saved me from the snakes. We’re responsible for each other’s lives now.”

“Are we?” he asked.

“Sure,” she said. “You’re mine and I’m yours. It’s written in the stars.”

“No escaping that.” He leaned over and kissed her, flushed with happiness, because although he did not believe in celestial writings, she did, and that would be enough to guarantee her loyalty.

Coriolanus stopped in his tracks. “Dean Highbottom? Dean Highbottom gave you money?”

“In neutral?” Coriolanus asked.

“In neutral?” He heard his voice echo from the bird’s beak. “In neutral?”

Even creepier when it’s your own voice, he thought, but he gave a delighted laugh. “That was me!”

“That was me!” the jabberjay said in his voice, and then began to mimic a nearby bird.

“It was indeed,” said Dr. Kay. “But in neutral, he’ll move on to something else quickly. Another voice. Usually, just a short phrase. Or a snatch of birdsong. Whatever catches his fancy. For surveillance, we needed to put him in record mode. Fingers crossed.” She pressed one of the buttons on her remote control.

Coriolanus heard nothing. “Oh, no. I guess it’s too old.”

Dr. Kay’s face, however, wore a smile. “Not necessarily. The command tones are inaudible to human beings but easily registered by the birds. Notice how quiet he is?”

The jabberjay had fallen silent. It hopped around in its trap, cocking its head, pecking at things, the same in all ways except its verbalizing.

“Is it working?” asked Coriolanus.

“We’ll see.” Dr. Kay hit another button on her control, and the bird resumed its normal chirping. “Neutral again. Now let’s see what he’s retained.” She pressed a third button.

After a brief pause, the bird began to speak.

“Oh, no. I guess it’s too old.”

“Not necessarily. The command tones are inaudible to human beings but easily registered by the birds. Notice how quiet he is?”

“Is it working?”

“We’ll see.”

An exact replica. But no. The rustling of the trees, the buzzing of the insects, the other birds, none of that had been recorded. Only the pure sound of the human voices.

“Huh,” said Coriolanus, somewhat impressed. “How long can they record for?”

“An hour or so, on a good day,” Dr. Kay told him. “They’re designed to seek out forested areas and then are attracted to human voices. We’d release them into the woods in record mode, then retrieve them with a homing signal back at the base, where we’d analyze the recordings. Not just here, but in Districts Eleven, Nine, wherever we thought they’d be of value.”

“You couldn’t just set microphones in the trees?” Coriolanus asked.

“You can bug buildings, but the forest is too large. The rebels knew the terrain well; we didn’t. They moved from place to place. The jabberjay is an organic, mobile recording device and, unlike a microphone, it’s undetectable. The rebels could catch one, kill it, eat it even, and all they would find is an ordinary bird,” explained Dr. Kay. “They are perfect, in theory.”

“But in practice, the rebels figured out what they were,” said Coriolanus. “How did they manage that?”

“Not entirely sure. Some thought they saw the birds returning to base, but we only recalled them in the dead of night, in which they’re virtually impossible to detect, and only a few at a time. More likely we didn’t cover our tracks. Didn’t make sure that the information we acted on could have had a source other than a recording in the woods. That would’ve brought suspicion, and even though their black feathers are an excellent camouflage at night, their activity after hours would be a clue. Then, I think, they just started experimenting with them, feeding us false information and seeing how we reacted.” She shrugged. “Or maybe they had a spy on the base. I doubt we’ll ever really know.”

“Why don’t you just use the homing device to call them back to the base now? Instead of —” Coriolanus stopped himself, not wanting to seem like a whiner.

“Instead of dragging you out in this heat to be eaten alive by mosquitoes?” She laughed. “The whole transmission system was dismantled, and our old aviary seems to store supplies now. Besides, I’d rather have my hands on them. We don’t want them to fly off and never come back, do we?”

At the end of the war, I released them on neutral. It would have been cruel otherwise. A mute bird would have faced too many challenges. They not only survived but mated successfully with the mockingbirds. So now we have a whole new species.” Dr. Kay pointed up at a mockingjay in the foliage. “Mockingjays, the locals call them.”

“And what can they do?” asked Coriolanus.

“Not sure. I’ve been watching them for the last few days. They’ve no ability to mimic speech. But they have a better, more sustained ability to repeat music than their mothers,” she said. “Sing something.”

Coriolanus only had one song in his repertoire.

Gem of Panem,Mighty city,Through the ages, you shine anew.

The mockingjay cocked its head and then sang back. No words, but an exact replica of the melody, in a voice that seemed half human, half bird. A few other birds in the area picked it up and wove it into a harmonic fabric, which again reminded him of the Covey with their old songs.

“We should kill them all.” The words slipped out before he could stop them.

“Kill them all? Why?” said Dr. Kay in surprise.

“They’re unnatural.” He tried to twist the comment so it sounded like it came from a bird lover. “Perhaps they’ll hurt the other species.”

“They appear to be rather compatible. And they’re all over Panem, wherever jabberjays and mockingbirds cohabited. We’ll take some back and see if they can reproduce, mockingjay with mockingjay. If they can’t, they’ll all be gone in a few years anyway. If they can, what’s one more songbird?” she said.

Coriolanus agreed they were probably harmless. He spent the rest of the afternoon asking questions and treating the birds gently to make up for his callous suggestion. He didn’t mind the jabberjays so much — they seemed rather interesting from a military standpoint — but something about the mockingjays repelled him. He distrusted their spontaneous creation. Nature running amok. They should die out, and die out soon.

All appeared to have retained the ability to record and play the human voice.

Out of earshot of the scientists, Bug shook his head. “Is that good for them?”

“I don’t know. It’s what they’re built to do,” said Coriolanus.

“They’d be happier if we just left them in the woods,” said Bug.

Coriolanus wasn’t sure Bug was right. For all he knew, they’d wake up in the Citadel lab in a few days, wondering what that atrocious ten-year nightmare in District 12 had been. Maybe they’d be happier in a controlled environment, where so many threats had been removed. “I’m sure the scientists will take good care of them."

Maude Ivory pulled back the paper and gave a little hop on one foot before she dipped into a curtsy. “Thank you kindly. I’ll sing you a special song tonight!”

“I came with no other hope,” said Coriolanus. It was funny how the society talk of the Capitol seemed natural with the Covey."

Coriolanus thought that a bit dramatic but tried to sound comforting. “I don’t think there’s a human equivalent.”

“Really? Do you always feel free to speak your mind, Coriolanus Snow?” she asked, giving him a quizzical look.

Free to speak his mind? Of course, he did. Well, within reason. He didn’t go around shooting his mouth off about every little thing. What did she mean? She meant what he thought about the Capitol. And the Hunger Games. And the districts. The truth was, most of what the Capitol did, he supported, and the rest rarely concerned him. But if it came to it, he’d speak out. Wouldn’t he? Against the Capitol? Like Sejanus had? Even if it meant repercussions? He didn’t know, but he felt on the defensive. “I do. I think you should say what you think."

“The Covey believe you’re put on earth to reduce the misery, not add to it. Do you think the Hunger Games are right?” she asked.

“I’m not even sure why we do them, to be honest. But I do think people are forgetting the war too fast. What we did to each other. What we’re capable of. Districts and Capitol both. I know the Capitol must seem hard-line out here, but we’re just trying to keep things under control. Otherwise, there’d be chaos and people running around killing each other, like in the arena.” This was the first time he’d tried to put these thoughts into words with anyone other than Dr. Gaul. He felt a little unsteady, like a toddler learning to walk, but he felt the independence of getting on his feet as well.

Lucy Gray drew back a bit. “That’s what you think people would do?”

“I do. Unless there’s law, and someone enforcing it, I think we might as well be animals,” he said with more assurance. “Like it or not, the Capitol is the only thing keeping anyone safe.”

“Hm. So they keep me safe. And what do I give up for that?” she asked."

Coriolanus was on the verge of dozing off when the mockingjays, who’d listened quite respectfully to Lucy Gray’s rendition, began one of their own. He felt his body tense and the pleasant drowsiness drain away. But the Covey were all smiles as the birds ran off with the song.

“Like sandstones to diamonds, that’s what we are to them,” said Tam Amber.

“Well … they practice more,” said Clerk Carmine, and the others laughed.

Listening to the birds, Coriolanus noticed the absence of jabberjays. The only explanation he could think of was that the mockingjays had begun to reproduce without them, either with one another or with the local mockingbirds. This elimination of the Capitol birds from the equation deeply disturbed him. Here they were, multiplying like rabbits, completely unchecked. Unauthorized. Co-opting Capitol technology. He didn’t like it one bit.

Up to four sometimes, if their cages were close together. He always took care to erase them by doing a final quick recording in which he was silent, ensuring his voice would not end up back in the Citadel lab. He stopped with the singing entirely when the mockingjays began to pick it up, even if there was a certain satisfaction in hearing them pipe out praise for the Capitol. He had no way to silence them, and they could string one melody out endlessly.

On the whole, he was beginning to weary of the infusion of music into his life. Invasion might be a better word. It seemed to be everywhere these days: birdsong, Covey song, bird-and-Covey song.

Once the gun was gone, there’d be nothing to connect him to the murders. Absolutely nothing.

No, wait. There would be one thing. Lucy Gray.

Well, no matter. She would never tell. She wouldn’t be thrilled, obviously, when he told her there’d been a change of plans. That he was returning to the Peacekeepers and heading to District 2 tomorrow at dawn, essentially leaving her to her fate. Still, she’d never rat him out. It wasn’t her style, and it would implicate her in the murders as well. It would mean she could wind up dead, and as the Hunger Games had shown, Lucy Gray possessed an extraordinary talent for self-preservation. Plus, she loved him. She’d said so last night in the song. Even more, she trusted him. Although, if he ditched her in the woods to claw out an existence alone, no doubt she would consider that a breach of faith. He had to think of just the right way to break the news. But what would that be? “I love you deeply, but I love officers’ school more?” That wasn’t going to go over well.

And he did love her! He did! It was just that, only a few hours into his new life in the wilderness, he knew he hated it. The heat, and the worms, and those birds yakking nonstop …

She was certainly taking a long time with those potatoes.

Coriolanus glanced out the window. The rain had diminished to a sprinkle.

She hadn’t wanted to go by herself. Too lonely. Her song said that she needed, loved, and trusted him, but would she forgive him? Even if he deserted her? Billy Taupe had crossed her, and he’d ended up dead. He could hear him now …

“Makes me sick how you’re playing the kids. Poor Lucy Gray. Poor lamb.”

Then the calculated way she’d taken out Treech, baiting him to attack her, really, so she could whip that snake out of her pocket.

Because she’d figured it out. All of it. That destroying the guns would wash away all physical evidence of his connection to the murders. That he no longer wanted to run away. That she was the last witness to tie him to the crime. But they’d always had each other’s backs, so why would she suddenly think he might harm her? Why, when only yesterday, he’d been pure as the driven snow?

Sejanus. She must have figured out that Sejanus was the third person Coriolanus had killed. She wouldn’t have to know anything about the stunt with the jabberjays, only that he’d been Sejanus’s confidant, and that Sejanus was a rebel, while Coriolanus was a defender of the Capitol. Still, to think he’d kill her? He looked down at the loaded gun in his hands. Maybe he should’ve left it in the shed. It looked bad coming after her armed. As if he was hunting her. But he wasn’t really going to kill her. Just talk to her and make sure she saw sense.

Put down the gun, he told himself, but his hands refused to cooperate. All she has is a knife. A big knife. The best he could manage was to sling the gun onto his back. “Lucy Gray! Are you okay? You’re scaring me! Where are you?”

And he hadn’t. He pushed through the branches and into a small clearing canopied by trees. The orange scarf lay across some briars, where it had apparently blown loose and snagged as she fled. Oh, well. It confirmed he was on the right track. He went to retrieve it — maybe he’d keep it after all — when a faint rustle in the leaves pulled him up short. He’d just registered the snake when it struck, uncoiling like a spring and digging its teeth into the forearm extended toward the scarf.

“Aa!” he screamed in pain. It released him immediately and slithered into the brush before he even had a chance to get a good look at it. Panic set in as he stared at the red, arched bite mark on his forearm. Panic and disbelief. Lucy Gray had tried to kill him! This was no coincidence. The trailing scarf. The poised snake. Maude Ivory had said she always knew where to find them. This was a booby trap, and he’d walked straight into it! Poor lamb, indeed! He was beginning to sympathize with Billy Taupe.

Coriolanus knew nothing about snakes, other than the rainbow ones in the arena. Feet rooted to the ground, heart racing, he expected to die on the spot, but while the wound hurt, he was still standing. He didn’t know how long he might have, but by all things Snow, she was going to pay for this. Should he tie off the arm with a tourniquet? Suck out the venom? They hadn’t done survival training yet. Afraid his first aid treatments might only spread the poison more swiftly through his system, he yanked his sleeve down over his forearm, pulled his rifle off his shoulder, and started after her. If he’d felt better, he’d have laughed at the irony of how quickly their relationship had deteriorated into their own private Hunger Games.

She wasn’t so easy to track now, and he realized the earlier clues had been left to lead him directly to the snake. But she couldn’t be that far away. She’d want to know if the thing killed him, or if she should form another plan of attack. Maybe she hoped he’d pass out so she could cut his throat with the long knife.

Coriolanus remembered the conversation he’d had with Sejanus as they’d unpacked his duffel. “I’d elaborate on it. They’re not just to punish the districts, they’re part of the eternal war. Each one is its own battle. One we can hold in the palm of our hand, instead of waging a real war that could get out of our control.”

“Hm.” She swung a mouse away from a gaping mouth. “You there, don’t be greedy.”

“And they’re a reminder of what we did to each other, what we have the potential to do again, because of who we are,” he continued.

“And who are we, did you determine?” she asked.

“Creatures who need the Capitol to survive.” He couldn’t help getting in a dig. “It’s all pointless, though, you know. The Hunger Games. No one in Twelve even watches it. Except for the reaping. We didn’t even have a working television on base.”

“While that could be a problem in the future, it’s a blessing this year, given that I’ve had to erase the whole mess,” said Dr. Gaul. “It was a mistake getting the students mixed up in it. Especially when they started dropping like flies. Presented the Capitol as far too vulnerable.”

“You erased it?” he asked.

“Every last copy gone, never to be aired again.” She grinned. “I’ve a master in the vault, of course, but that’s just for my own amusement.”

He was glad about the erasure. It was just one more way to eliminate Lucy Gray from the world. The Capitol would forget her, the districts barely knew her, and District 12 had never accepted her as one of their own. In a few years, there would be a vague memory that a girl had once sung in the arena. And then that would be forgotten, too. Good-bye, Lucy Gray, we hardly knew you.

“Not a total loss. I think we’ll bring Flickerman back next year. And your idea about the betting is a keeper,” she said.

He looked gorgeous in his new suit, especially with the return of his curls, and his stint as a Peacekeeper had given him a certain cachet that drove his rivals wild.

He’d just finished a special honors class in military strategy with Dr. Gaul, after a morning at the Citadel, where he’d reported for his Gamemaker internship. If you wanted to call it that — really the others treated him as a full-fledged member of the team. They were already working on ideas to engage the districts, as well as the Capitol, in next year’s Hunger Games. Snow had been the one to point out that, other than the life of two tributes they might not even know, the people in the districts had no stake in the Games. A tribute’s win needed to be a win for the whole district. They’d come up with the idea that everyone in the district would receive a parcel of food if their tribute took the crown. And to tempt a better class of tributes to possibly volunteer, Snow suggested that the victor should be given a house in a special area of town, tentatively called the Victor’s Village, which would be the envy of all those people in the hovels. That, and a token monetary prize, should go a long way toward bringing in a decent crop of performers."

He still tripped over what to call them. “Ma” was easy enough, but it didn’t suit to call Strabo Plinth his father, so he used “sir” a lot. It wasn’t as if they’d adopted him; he’d been too old at eighteen. Being designated an heir worked better for him anyway. He’d never give up the name Snow, not even for a munitions empire.

It had all happened very naturally. His homecoming. Their grief. The merging of the families. Sejanus’s death had totaled the Plinths. Strabo had put it simply: “My wife needs something to live for. So do I, for that matter. You’ve lost your parents. We’ve lost our son. I was thinking perhaps we could work something out.” He’d bought the Snows’ apartment so they didn’t have to move, and the Dolittles’ below it for himself and Ma. There was talk of renovating, of building a spiral staircase and perhaps a private elevator to connect the two, but there was no rush. Ma already came by daily to help with the Grandma’am, who’d resigned herself to having a new “maid,” and she and Tigris got on swimmingly. The Plinths paid for everything now: the taxes on the apartment, his tuition, the cook. They gave him a generous allowance as well. This was helpful because, although he’d intercepted and pocketed the envelope of money he’d sent Tigris from District 12, university life was expensive when done right. Strabo never questioned his expenditures or nitpicked over a few new additions to his wardrobe, and he seemed pleased when Snow asked for advice. They were surprisingly compatible. At times, he almost forgot old Plinth was district. Almost.

Tonight would’ve been Sejanus’s nineteenth birthday, and they were gathering for a quiet dinner to remember him. Snow had invited Festus and Lysistrata to join the party, as they’d liked Sejanus better than most of his classmates and could be counted on to say nice things. "

The fresh air on the walk to the Academy left his mind razor sharp. He hadn’t bothered to make an appointment, preferring to drop in unexpectedly. The students had been let out an hour ago, and his footsteps rang in the hallways. Dean Highbottom’s secretary’s desk was empty, so he crossed to the dean’s office and tapped on the door. Dean Highbottom bid him enter. Between the weight loss and the tremor, he looked worse than ever, slumped over his desk.

“Well, to what do I owe this honor?” he asked.

“I was hoping to recover my mother’s compact, since you should have no further need of it,” Snow replied.

Dean Highbottom reached into a drawer and slapped the compact on the desk. “Is that all?”

“No.” He removed Sejanus’s box from his satchel. “I’m returning Sejanus’s personal effects to his parents tonight. I’m not sure what to do with this.” He emptied the contents onto the desk and picked up the framed diploma. “I didn’t think you’d want it floating around out there. An Academy diploma. Awarded to a traitor.”

“You’re very conscientious,” said Dean Highbottom.

“That’s my Peacekeeper training.” Snow loosened the back of the frame and slipped out the diploma. Then, as if on impulse, he replaced it with a photo of the Plinth family. “I think his parents will prefer this anyway.” They both stared at the remains of Sejanus’s life. Then he swept the three medicine bottles into Dean Highbottom’s trash can. “The fewer bad memories, the better.”

Dean Highbottom eyed him. “So, you grew a heart in the districts?”

“Not in the districts. In the Hunger Games,” Snow corrected him. “I have you to thank for that. After all, you’re responsible for them.”

“Oh, I think half the credit for that goes to your father,” said the dean.

Snow frowned. “How do you mean? I thought the Hunger Games were your idea. Something you came up with at the University?”

“For Dr. Gaul’s class. Which I was failing, since my loathing of her made participation impossible. We paired off for the final project, so I was with my best friend — Crassus, of course. The assignment was to create a punishment for one’s enemies so extreme that they would never be allowed to forget how they had wronged you. It was like a puzzle, which I excel at, and like all good creations, absurdly simple at its core. The Hunger Games. The evilest impulse, cleverly packaged into a sporting event. An entertainment. I was drunk and your father got me drunker still, playing on my vanity as I fleshed the thing out, assuring me it was just a private joke. The next morning, I awoke, horrified by what I’d made, meaning to rip it to shreds, but it was too late. Without my permission, your father had given it to Dr. Gaul. He wanted the grade, you see. I never forgave him.”

“He’s dead,” said Snow.

“But she isn’t,” Dean Highbottom shot back. “It was never meant to be anything more than theoretical. And who but the vilest monster would stage it? After the war, she pulled my proposal out, and me with it, introducing me to Panem as the architect of the Hunger Games. That night, I tried morphling for the first time. I thought the thing would die out, it was so ghastly. It didn’t. Dr. Gaul took it and ran, and she has dragged me along with it for the last ten years.”

“It certainly supports her view of humanity,” said Snow. “Especially using the children.”

“And why is that?” asked Dean Highbottom.

“Because we credit them with innocence. And if even the most innocent among us turn to killers in the Hunger Games, what does that say? That our essential nature is violent,” Snow explained.

“Self-destructive,” Dean Highbottom murmured.

Snow remembered Pluribus’s account of his father’s falling out with Dean Highbottom and quoted the letter. “Like moths to a flame.” The dean’s eyes narrowed, but Snow only smiled and said, “But, of course, you’re testing me. You know her far better than I do.”"

“I expect it made us both a little sad.” Snow pocketed the compact and gathered Sejanus’s things. “I’d better go. We have a new living room set being delivered, and I promised my cousin I’d be there to oversee the movers.”

Spinning, lacemaking, sericulture, embroidery and other textile-related crafts could give women economic power and status. In England in 1750, for example, spinning was the most common paid form of employment for women and a relatively lucrative one at that. Single women were estimated at the time to be able to spin around six pounds of wool per week; a married woman would probably only be able to manage two and a half pounds. Given the current rates offered, a spinster would therefore have been able to earn as much in a week as a skilled weaver – who were more usually men and were often in guilds, meaning their work was thought of as more valuable.

She wanted to bask in their “bash,” admiring their handiwork. But as she looked around, she noticed the conservator still lying in a pile of pulverized marble. She went over to him and helped him up. She didn’t expect a thank-you, but neither did she expect the response she got.
The moment he saw who it was, the man recoiled. “What are you still doing here?” he snapped. “Your session is over. Hurry along.”
“I… I just… Are you okay?”
He had a bit of blood on his nose, but he wiped it away. “Of course I am, or I will be in a minute or two. Now, please, you have to leave—we only have ten minutes to reset.”
Kila noticed that the swelling from the pummeling that Sterox had given him was already going away. Only supercharged healing nanites could work that quickly.
Then, seemingly out of the woodwork, came a crew of at least a dozen workers to clear out the debris. Others were rolling in new display cases of china, glass, and clay pots.
“So… it wasn’t real.”
“Did it feel real?”
“Yes… kind of.”
“Then that’s all that matters, isn’t it?”
The conservator, seeing Kila’s bewildered expression, leaned in a bit closer and spoke a little more quietly. “Listen, do you really think the Thunderhead would allow you to destroy precious originals? Young lady, the world is overflowing with artists who do nothing but create replicas of ancient art. Something must be done with it all. Truth be told, you’re providing a service, really.”

Maw hesitated, perhaps weighing whether any of it was worth denying anymore. Then she said, “All Apocalytes are.”

Did she really believe that Thrash could come up with malware that could shut down Thunderhead cameras?

“Help me,” Killa said. “One of the cloudtechs got her!”
They helped carry Maw to the truck.

Killa stayed with her, letting Maw rest her head in her lap as they made their escape. Bleary-eyed but still conscious, Maw looked up at Killa.

You, who have drawn the enmity of your colleagues by choosing against all common sense to do what’s difficult rather than what’s expedient. You, who fight a noble battle to hold on to something that may already be lost.

“You will not get away with this! I will bring my grievances to conclave!”

Occasionally immunity is taken from me, unbidden—but to those who grab my hand and kiss my ring, I hold no ill will. Because in those instances, immunity is their choice, not mine.

And that’s when Dalí saw Scythe Gaudí.
He was down there in the plaza with the crowd, standing just beside the crossbow.
Dalí was furious! Gaudí would knock the crossbow so that its arrow would fly wild! He would ruin another perfect gleaning, and humiliate Dalí yet again. Dalí could barely control his rage!
The torch ignited the rope. Fire raced along the rope toward a lever that would trigger the crossbow.
And down below Gaudí did not move.
He did not lift a finger to misalign the crossbow.
Why was he not sabotaging this?
The flame was nearly to the trigger.
What are you doing, you fool? Dalí screamed within his own mind. Ruin this! Save the girl! Why are you just standing there!
Gaudí met eyes with Dalí across the distance as if there were no distance at all. And instead of reaching for the crossbow, Gaudí put his hands on his hips.
The flame reached the lever.
The lever pulled the trigger.
The crossbow fired.
And Dalí, wailing at the top of his lungs, hurled himself in front of Penélope. He felt the arrow enter his back. The pain was sharp and pronounced. Suddenly there were doves flapping all around him, escaping to the sky. He collapsed, but was eased down onto the platform by Penélope, who held him in her arms.
And down below the crowd cheered.
“Bravo!” they cried. “This is the greatest self-gleaning any scythe has ever achieved! Such a surprising finale! He had us all fooled! Bravo!”
And it occurred to Dalí this had been Gaudí’s plan all along. He had tricked Dalí into self-gleaning. Penélope was planted for the purpose! She was merely a gear in her uncle’s machine.
But if that were true, then why was Penélope crying?

“But… I… must die now,” he said. “Anything less would be… would be…”
“Absurd?” said Penélope. “Your Honor, everything about you is absurd—why should this be any different.”
Dalí heaved a weighty sigh. “Damn,” he said. “I should have dipped the arrow in poison.”
But, as they say, hindsight is twenty-twenty. And unless he now hurled himself from the platform, it seemed increasingly clear that he wasn’t going to die. How awkward. How humiliating. And yet in that moment something occurred to him that gave him a twinge of joy.
“If I am to live, this will not have been in vain. I will take you on as my apprentice,” Dalí told Penélope. “You shall train to be a scythe under my skilled tutelage.”
Penélope laughed. “That will really piss off my uncle.”

Then he smiled a pegasus smile at her, which involved ears going in different directions and a wrinkled nose which did not expose the teeth. She’d been startled, and startled into wondering if perhaps she’d underestimated her brothers’ pegasi. It was a point of honour as a much-patronised little sister to underestimate her brothers.

Research has demonstrated that persons meditating together tend to move into collective patterns of synchronized brainwave functioning. If this synchronized brainwave pattern were sufficiently stable, it might begin to resemble a condition known in chaos theory as “phase lock.” Phase locking occurs in nature when individual oscillating systems shift from a state of collective chaos to integrated resonance. For example, if individual cells from a chicken embryo heart are separated from each other, they beat erratically. If they are recombined one by one, when a certain number of cells are present, they spontaneously phase lock and begin to beat in unison.17"

It does not behave the way we expected. This reminds me, years ago there was something called the sound barrier. Airplanes were supposed not to be able to go faster than the speed of sound because, if you designed them normally and then tried to put the speed of sound in the equations, the propeller wouldn’t work and the wings don’t lift and nothing works correctly. Nevertheless, airplanes can go faster than the speed of sound. You just have to know what the right laws are under the right circumstances, and design the device with the correct laws. You cannot expect old designs to work in new circumstances. But new designs can work in new circumstances, and I assert that it is perfectly possible to make transistor systems, or, more correctly, switching systems and computing devices, in which the dimensions are smaller than the mean free path.

You don’t know how you got there and you have to build them up again, and if you’re interrupted and kind of forget half the idea of how the cards went together–your cards being different-type parts of the ideas, ideas of different kinds that have to go together to build up the idea–the main point is, you put the stuff together, it’s quite a tower and it’s easy [for it] to slip, it needs a lot of concentration–that is, solid time to think–and if you’ve got a job in administrating anything like that, then you don’t have the solid time.

We start with it full on the right but empty on the left with the valve closed. If we now open the valve, the water will slip over to the other side, and we can close the valve again, just in time to catch the water in the left arm. Now when we want to go the other way, we open the valve again and the water slips back to the other side and we catch it again. There is some loss and the water doesn’t climb as high as it did before, but all we have to do is to put a little water in to correct the loss–a much smaller energy loss than the direct fill method.

All the operations in the computer can go forward or backward. The computation proceeds for a while one way and then it un-does itself, “uncalculates,” and then goes forward again and so on.

rien suffisait parfois pour interrompre les élans du cœur, changer le
cours de la pensée. J’entendais plusieurs fois par an mon grand-père
raconter à table des anecdotes toujours les mêmes sur l’attitude
qu’avait eue M. Swann le père, à la mort de sa femme qu’il avait
veillée jour et nuit. Mon grand-père qui ne l’avait pas vu depuis
longtemps était accouru auprès de lui dans la propriété que les Swann
possédaient aux environs de Combray, et avait réussi, pour qu’il
n’assistât pas à la mise en bière, à lui faire quitter un moment, tout
en pleurs, la chambre mortuaire. Ils firent quelques pas dans le parc

grand-père par le bras, s’était écrié: «Ah! mon vieil ami, quel
bonheur de se promener ensemble par ce beau temps. Vous ne trouvez pas
ça joli tous ces arbres, ces aubépines et mon étang dont vous ne
m’avez jamais félicité? Vous avez l’air comme un bonnet de nuit.
Sentez-vous ce petit vent? Ah! on a beau dire, la vie a du bon tout de

revint, et trouvant sans doute trop compliqué de chercher comment il
avait pu à un pareil moment se laisser aller à un mouvement de joie,
il se contenta, par un geste qui lui était familier chaque fois qu’une
question ardue se présentait à son esprit, de passer la main sur son
front, d’essuyer ses yeux et les verres de son lorgnon. Il ne put
pourtant pas se consoler de la mort de sa femme, mais pendant les deux
années qu’il lui survécut, il disait à mon grand-père: «C’est drôle,
je pense très souvent à ma pauvre femme, mais je ne peux y penser
beaucoup à la fois.» «Souvent, mais peu à la fois, comme le pauvre
père Swann», était devenu une des phrases favorites de mon grand-père
qui la prononçait à propos des choses les plus différentes. Il
m’aurait paru que ce père de Swann était un monstre, si mon grand-père
que je considérais comme meilleur juge et dont la sentence faisant

Swann, le fils, vint souvent les voir à Combray, ma grand’tante et mes
grands-parents ne soupçonnèrent pas qu’il ne vivait plus du tout dans
la société qu’avait fréquentée sa famille et que sous l’espèce
d’incognito que lui faisait chez nous ce nom de Swann, ils
hébergeaient,—avec la parfaite innocence d’honnêtes hôteliers qui ont
chez eux, sans le savoir, un célèbre brigand,—un des membres les plus
élégants du Jockey-Club, ami préféré du comte de Paris et du prince de
Galles, un des hommes les plus choyés de la haute société du faubourg
Saint-Germain.


L’ignorance où nous étions de cette brillante vie mondaine que menait
Swann tenait évidemment en partie à la réserve et à la discrétion de
son caractère, mais aussi à ce que les bourgeois d’alors se faisaient
de la société une idée un peu hindoue et la considéraient comme
composée de castes fermées où chacun, dès sa naissance, se trouvait
placé dans le rang qu’occupaient ses parents, et d’où rien, à moins
des hasards d’une carrière exceptionnelle ou d’un mariage inespéré, ne
pouvait vous tirer pour vous faire pénétrer dans une caste supérieure.
M. Swann, le père, était agent de change; le «fils Swann» se trouvait
faire partie pour toute sa vie d’une caste où les fortunes, comme dans
une catégorie de contribuables, variaient entre tel et tel revenu. On
savait quelles avaient été les fréquentations de son père, on savait
donc quelles étaient les siennes, avec quelles personnes il était «en
situation» de frayer. S’il en connaissait d’autres, c’étaient
relations de jeune homme sur lesquelles des amis anciens de sa
famille, comme étaient mes parents, fermaient d’autant plus
bienveillamment les yeux qu’il continuait, depuis qu’il était
orphelin, à venir très fidèlement nous voir; mais il y avait fort à
parier que ces gens inconnus de nous qu’il voyait, étaient de ceux
qu’il n’aurait pas osé saluer si, étant avec nous, il les avait
rencontrés. Si l’on avait voulu à toute force appliquer à Swann un
coefficient social qui lui fût personnel, entre les autres fils
d’agents de situation égale à celle de ses parents, ce coefficient eût
été pour lui un peu inférieur parce que, très simple de façon et ayant
toujours eu une «toquade» d’objets anciens et de peinture, il
demeurait maintenant dans un vieil hôtel où il entassait ses
collections et que ma grand’mère rêvait de visiter, mais qui était
situé quai d’Orléans, quartier que ma grand’tante trouvait infamant
d’habiter. «Êtes-vous seulement connaisseur? je vous demande cela dans
votre intérêt, parce que vous devez vous faire repasser des croûtes
par les marchands», lui disait ma grand’tante; elle ne lui supposait
en effet aucune compétence et n’avait pas haute idée même au point de
vue intellectuel d’un homme qui dans la conversation évitait les
sujets sérieux et montrait une précision fort prosaïque non seulement
quand il nous donnait, en entrant dans les moindres détails, des
recettes de cuisine, mais même quand les sœurs de ma grand’mère
parlaient de sujets artistiques. Provoqué par elles à donner son avis,
à exprimer son admiration pour un tableau, il gardait un silence
presque désobligeant et se rattrapait en revanche s’il pouvait fournir
sur le musée où il se trouvait, sur la date où il avait été peint, un
renseignement matériel. Mais d’habitude il se contentait de chercher à
nous amuser en racontant chaque fois une histoire nouvelle qui venait
de lui arriver avec des gens choisis parmi ceux que nous connaissions,
avec le pharmacien de Combray, avec notre cuisinière, avec notre
cocher. Certes ces récits faisaient rire ma grand’tante, mais sans
qu’elle distinguât bien si c’était à cause du rôle ridicule que s’y
donnait toujours Swann ou de l’esprit qu’il mettait à les conter: «On
peut dire que vous êtes un vrai type, monsieur Swann!» Comme elle
était la seule personne un peu vulgaire de notre famille, elle avait
soin de faire remarquer aux étrangers, quand on parlait de Swann,
qu’il aurait pu, s’il avait voulu, habiter boulevard Haussmann ou
avenue de l’Opéra, qu’il était le fils de M. Swann qui avait dû lui
laisser quatre ou cinq millions, mais que c’était sa fantaisie.
Fantaisie qu’elle jugeait du reste devoir être si divertissante pour
les autres, qu’à Paris, quand M. Swann venait le 1er janvier lui
apporter son sac de marrons glacés, elle ne manquait pas, s’il y avait
du monde, de lui dire: «Eh bien! M. Swann, vous habitez toujours près
de l’Entrepôt des vins, pour être sûr de ne pas manquer le train quand

après nos dîners hebdomadaires, autour de la table de jeu ou au
jardin, durant notre vie de bon voisinage campagnard. L’enveloppe
corporelle de notre ami en avait été si bien bourrée, ainsi que de
quelques souvenirs relatifs à ses parents, que ce Swann-là était
devenu un être complet et vivant, et que j’ai l’impression de quitter
une personne pour aller vers une autre qui en est distincte, quand,
dans ma mémoire, du Swann que j’ai connu plus tard avec exactitude je
passe à ce premier Swann,—à ce premier Swann dans lequel je retrouve
les erreurs charmantes de ma jeunesse, et qui d’ailleurs ressemble
moins à l’autre qu’aux personnes que j’ai connues à la même époque,
comme s’il en était de notre vie ainsi que d’un musée où tous les
portraits d’un même temps ont un air de famille, une même tonalité—à
ce premier Swann rempli de loisir, parfumé par l’odeur du grand
marronnier, des paniers de framboises et d’un brin d’estragon.

Villeparisis, de la célèbre famille de Bouillon, celle-ci lui avait
dit: «Je crois que vous connaissez beaucoup M. Swann qui est un grand
ami de mes neveux des Laumes». Ma grand’mère était revenue de sa
visite enthousiasmée par la maison qui donnait sur des jardins et où
Mme  de Villeparisis lui conseillait de louer, et aussi par un giletier
et sa fille, qui avaient leur boutique dans la cour et chez qui elle
était entrée demander qu’on fît un point à sa jupe qu’elle avait
déchirée dans l’escalier. Ma grand’mère avait trouvé ces gens
parfaits, elle déclarait que la petite était une perle et que le
giletier était l’homme le plus distingué, le mieux qu’elle eût jamais
vu. Car pour elle, la distinction était quelque chose d’absolument
indépendant du rang social. Elle s’extasiait sur une réponse que le
giletier lui avait faite, disant à maman: «Sévigné n’aurait pas mieux
dit!» et en revanche, d’un neveu de Mme  de Villeparisis qu’elle avait
rencontré chez elle: «Ah! ma fille, comme il est commun!»


Or le propos relatif à Swann avait eu pour effet non pas de relever
celui-ci dans l’esprit de ma grand’tante, mais d’y abaisser Mme  de
Villeparisis. Il semblait que la considération que, sur la foi de ma
grand’mère, nous accordions à Mme  de Villeparisis, lui créât un devoir
de ne rien faire qui l’en rendît moins digne et auquel elle avait
manqué en apprenant l’existence de Swann, en permettant à des parents
à elle de le fréquenter. «Comment elle connaît Swann? Pour une
personne que tu prétendais parente du maréchal de Mac-Mahon!» Cette
opinion de mes parents sur les relations de Swann leur parut ensuite
confirmée par son mariage avec une femme de la pire société, presque
une cocotte que, d’ailleurs, il ne chercha jamais à présenter,
continuant à venir seul chez nous, quoique de moins en moins, mais
d’après laquelle ils crurent pouvoir juger—supposant que c’était là
qu’il l’avait prise—le milieu, inconnu d’eux, qu’il fréquentait
habituellement.


Mais une fois, mon grand-père lut dans un journal que M. Swann était
un des plus fidèles habitués des déjeuners du dimanche chez le duc de
X..., dont le père et l’oncle avaient été les hommes d’État les plus
en vue du règne de Louis-Philippe. Or mon grand-père était curieux de
tous les petits faits qui pouvaient l’aider à entrer par la pensée
dans la vie privée d’hommes comme Molé, comme le duc Pasquier, comme
le duc de Broglie. Il fut enchanté d’apprendre que Swann fréquentait
des gens qui les avaient connus. Ma grand’tante au contraire
interpréta cette nouvelle dans un sens défavorable à Swann: quelqu’un
qui choisissait ses fréquentations en dehors de la caste où il était
né, en dehors de sa «classe» sociale, subissait à ses yeux un fâcheux
déclassement. Il lui semblait qu’on renonçât d’un coup au fruit de
toutes les belles relations avec des gens bien posés, qu’avaient
honorablement entretenues et engrangées pour leurs enfants les
familles prévoyantes; (ma grand’tante avait même cessé de voir le fils
d’un notaire de nos amis parce qu’il avait épousé une altesse et était
par là descendu pour elle du rang respecté de fils de notaire à celui
d’un de ces aventuriers, anciens valets de chambre ou garçons
d’écurie, pour qui on raconte que les reines eurent parfois des
bontés)."

Saint-Simon quelque chose qui vous aurait amusé. C’est dans le volume
sur son ambassade d’Espagne; ce n’est pas un des meilleurs, ce n’est
guère qu’un journal, mais du moins un journal merveilleusement écrit,
ce qui fait déjà une première différence avec les assommants journaux
que nous nous croyons obligés de lire matin et soir.» «Je ne suis pas
de votre avis, il y a des jours où la lecture des journaux me semble
fort agréable...», interrompit ma tante Flora, pour montrer qu’elle
avait lu la phrase sur le Corot de Swann dans le Figaro. «Quand ils
parlent de choses ou de gens qui nous intéressent!» enchérit ma tante
Céline. «Je ne dis pas non, répondit Swann étonné. Ce que je reproche
aux journaux c’est de nous faire faire attention tous les jours à des
choses insignifiantes tandis que nous lisons trois ou quatre fois dans
notre vie les livres où il y a des choses essentielles. Du moment que
nous déchirons fiévreusement chaque matin la bande du journal, alors
on devrait changer les choses et mettre dans le journal, moi je ne
sais pas, les... Pensées de Pascal! (il détacha ce mot d’un ton
d’emphase ironique pour ne pas avoir l’air pédant). Et c’est dans le
volume doré sur tranches que nous n’ouvrons qu’une fois tous les dix
ans, ajouta-t-il en témoignant pour les choses mondaines ce dédain
qu’affectent certains hommes du monde, que nous lirions que la reine
de Grèce est allée à Cannes ou que la princesse de Léon a donné un bal
costumé. Comme cela la juste proportion serait rétablie.» Mais

sérieuses: «Nous avons une bien belle conversation, dit-il
ironiquement, je ne sais pas pourquoi nous abordons ces «sommets», et
se tournant vers mon grand-père: «Donc Saint-Simon raconte que
Maulevrier avait eu l’audace de tendre la main à ses fils. Vous savez,
c’est ce Maulevrier dont il dit: «Jamais je ne vis dans cette épaisse
bouteille que de l’humeur, de la grossièreté et des sottises.»
«Épaisses ou non, je connais des bouteilles où il y a tout autre
chose», dit vivement Flora, qui tenait à avoir remercié Swann elle
aussi, car le présent de vin d’Asti s’adressait aux deux. Céline se
mit à rire. Swann interloqué reprit: «Je ne sais si ce fut ignorance
ou panneau, écrit Saint-Simon, il voulut donner la main à mes enfants.
Je m’en aperçus assez tôt pour l’en empêcher.» Mon grand-père
s’extasiait déjà sur «ignorance ou panneau», mais Mlle  Céline, chez
qui le nom de Saint-Simon,—un littérateur,—avait empêché l’anesthésie
complète des facultés auditives, s’indignait déjà: «Comment? vous
admirez cela? Eh bien! c’est du joli! Mais qu’est-ce que cela peut
vouloir dire; est-ce qu’un homme n’est pas autant qu’un autre?
Qu’est-ce que cela peut faire qu’il soit duc ou cocher s’il a de
l’intelligence et du cœur? Il avait une belle manière d’élever ses
enfants, votre Saint-Simon, s’il ne leur disait pas de donner la main
à tous les honnêtes gens. Mais c’est abominable, tout simplement. Et
vous osez citer cela?» Et mon grand-père navré, sentant
l’impossibilité, devant cette obstruction, de chercher à faire
raconter à Swann, les histoires qui l’eussent amusé disait à voix
basse à maman: «Rappelle-moi donc le vers que tu m’as appris et qui me
soulage tant dans ces moments-là. Ah"

ma tante qui était chargée de s’occuper de moi quand j’étais à
Combray, refusât de porter mon mot. Je me doutais que pour elle, faire
une commission à ma mère quand il y avait du monde lui paraîtrait
aussi impossible que pour le portier d’un théâtre de remettre une
lettre à un acteur pendant qu’il est en scène. Elle possédait à
l’égard des choses qui peuvent ou ne peuvent pas se faire un code
impérieux, abondant, subtil et intransigeant sur des distinctions
insaisissables ou oiseuses (ce qui lui donnait l’apparence de ces lois
antiques qui, à côté de prescriptions féroces comme de massacrer les
enfants à la mamelle, défendent avec une délicatesse exagérée de faire
bouillir le chevreau dans le lait de sa mère, ou de manger dans un
animal le nerf de la cuisse). Ce code, si l’on en jugeait par
l’entêtement soudain qu’elle mettait à ne pas vouloir faire certaines
commissions que nous lui donnions, semblait avoir prévu des
complexités sociales et des raffinements mondains tels que rien dans
l’entourage de Françoise et dans sa vie de domestique de village
n’avait pu les lui suggérer; et l’on était obligé de se dire qu’il y
avait en elle un passé français très ancien, noble et mal compris,
comme dans ces cités manufacturières où de vieux hôtels témoignent
qu’il y eut jadis une vie de cour, et où les ouvriers d’une usine de
produits chimiques travaillent au milieu de délicates sculptures qui
représentent le miracle de saint Théophile ou les quatre fils Aymon.
Dans le cas particulier, l’article du code à cause duquel il était peu
probable que sauf le cas d’incendie Françoise allât déranger maman en
présence de M. Swann pour un aussi petit personnage que moi, exprimait
simplement le respect qu’elle professait non seulement pour les
parents,—comme pour les morts, les prêtres et les rois,—mais encore
pour l’étranger à qui on donne l’hospitalité, respect qui m’aurait
peut-être touché dans un livre mais qui m’irritait toujours dans sa
bouche, à cause du ton grave et attendri qu’elle prenait pour en
parler, et davantage ce soir où le caractère sacré qu’elle conférait
au dîner avait pour effet qu’elle refuserait d’en troubler la
cérémonie. Mais pour mettre une chance de mon côté, je n’hésitai pas à
mentir et à lui dire que ce n’était pas du tout moi qui avais voulu
écrire à maman, mais que c’était maman qui, en me quittant, m’avait
recommandé de ne pas oublier de lui envoyer une réponse relativement à
un objet qu’elle m’avait prié de chercher; et elle serait certainement
très fâchée si on ne lui remettait pas ce mot. Je pense que Françoise
ne me crut pas, car, comme les hommes primitifs dont les sens étaient
plus puissants que les nôtres, elle discernait immédiatement, à des
signes insaisissables pour nous, toute vérité que nous voulions lui
cacher; elle regarda pendant cinq minutes l’enveloppe comme si
l’examen du papier et l’aspect de l’écriture allaient la renseigner
sur la nature du contenu ou lui apprendre à quel article de son code
elle devait se référer. Puis elle sortit d’un air résigné qui semblait
signifier: «C’est-il pas malheureux pour des parents d’avoir un enfant
pareil!» Elle revint au bout d’un moment me dire qu’on n’en était
encore qu’à la glace, qu’il était impossible au maître d’hôtel de
remettre la lettre en ce moment devant tout le monde, mais que, quand
on serait aux rince-bouche, on trouverait le moyen de la faire passer
à maman. "

permissions qui m’avaient été consenties dans les pactes plus larges
octroyés par ma mère et ma grand’mère parce qu’il ne se souciait pas
des «principes» et qu’il n’y avait pas avec lui de «Droit des gens».
Pour une raison toute contingente, ou même sans raison, il me
supprimait au dernier moment telle promenade si habituelle, si
consacrée, qu’on ne pouvait m’en priver sans parjure, ou bien, comme
il avait encore fait ce soir, longtemps avant l’heure rituelle, il me
disait: «Allons, monte te coucher, pas d’explication!» Mais aussi,
parce qu’il n’avait pas de principes (dans le sens de ma grand’mère),
il n’avait pas à proprement parler d’intransigeance. Il me regarda un
instant d’un air étonné et fâché, puis dès que maman lui eut expliqué
en quelques mots embarrassés ce qui était arrivé, il lui dit: «Mais va
donc avec lui, puisque tu disais justement que tu n’as pas envie de
dormir, reste un peu dans sa chambre, moi je n’ai besoin de rien.»
«Mais, mon ami, répondit timidement ma mère, que j’aie envie ou non de
dormir, ne change rien à la chose, on ne peut pas habituer cet

réalité ils n’ont jamais cessé; et c’est seulement parce que la vie se
tait maintenant davantage autour de moi que je les entends de nouveau,
comme ces cloches de couvents que couvrent si bien les bruits de la
ville pendant le jour qu’on les croirait arrêtées mais qui se
remettent à sonner dans le silence du soir.


Maman passa cette nuit-là dans ma chambre; au moment où je venais de
commettre une faute telle que je m’attendais à être obligé de quitter
la maison, mes parents m’accordaient plus que je n’eusse jamais obtenu
d’eux comme récompense d’une belle action. Même à l’heure où elle se
manifestait par cette grâce, la conduite de mon père à mon égard
gardait ce quelque chose d’arbitraire et d’immérité qui la
caractérisait et qui tenait à ce que généralement elle résultait
plutôt de convenances fortuites que d’un plan prémédité. Peut-être
même que ce que j’appelais sa sévérité, quand il m’envoyait me
coucher, méritait moins ce nom que celle de ma mère ou ma grand’mère,
car sa nature, plus différente en certains points de la mienne que
n’était la leur, n’avait probablement pas deviné jusqu’ici combien
j’étais malheureux tous les soirs, ce que ma mère et ma grand’mère
savaient bien; mais elles m’aimaient assez pour ne pas consentir à
m’épargner de la souffrance, elles voulaient m’apprendre à la dominer
afin de diminuer ma sensibilité nerveuse et fortifier ma volonté. Pour
mon père, dont l’affection pour moi était d’une autre sorte, je ne
sais pas s’il aurait eu ce courage: pour une fois où il venait de
comprendre que j’avais du chagrin, il avait dit à ma mère: «Va donc le
consoler.» Maman resta cette nuit-là dans ma chambre et, comme pour ne
gâter d’aucun remords ces heures si différentes de ce que j’avais eu
le droit d’espérer, quand Françoise, comprenant qu’il se passait
quelque chose d’extraordinaire en voyant maman assise près de moi, qui
me tenait la main et me laissait pleurer sans me gronder, lui demanda:
«Mais Madame, qu’a donc Monsieur à pleurer ainsi?» maman lui répondit:
«Mais il ne sait pas lui-même, Françoise, il est énervé; préparez-moi
vite le grand lit et montez vous coucher.» Ainsi, pour la première
fois, ma tristesse n’était plus considérée comme une faute punissable
mais comme un mal involontaire qu’on venait de reconnaître
officiellement, comme un état nerveux dont je n’étais pas responsable;
j’avais le soulagement de n’avoir plus à mêler de scrupules à
l’amertume de mes larmes, je pouvais pleurer sans péché. Je n’étais
pas non plus médiocrement fier vis-à-vis de Françoise de ce retour des
choses humaines, qui, une heure après que maman avait refusé de monter
dans ma chambre et m’avait fait dédaigneusement répondre que je
devrais dormir, m’élevait à la dignité de grande personne et m’avait
fait atteindre tout d’un coup à une sorte de puberté du chagrin,
d’émancipation des larmes. J’aurais dû être heureux: je ne l’étais
pas. Il me semblait que ma mère venait de me faire une première
concession qui devait lui être douloureuse, que c’était une première
abdication de sa part devant l’idéal qu’elle avait conçu pour moi, et
que pour la première fois, elle, si courageuse, s’avouait vaincue. Il
me semblait que si je venais de remporter une victoire c’était contre
elle, que j’avais réussi comme auraient pu faire la maladie, des
chagrins, ou l’âge, à détendre sa volonté, à faire fléchir sa raison
et que cette soirée commençait une ère, resterait comme une triste
date. Si j’avais osé maintenant, j’aurais dit à maman: «Non je ne veux
pas, ne couche pas ici.» Mais je connaissais la sagesse pratique,
réaliste comme on dirait aujourd’hui, qui tempérait en elle la nature
ardemment idéaliste de ma grand’mère, et je savais que, maintenant que
le mal était fait, elle aimerait mieux m’en laisser du moins goûter le
plaisir calmant et ne pas déranger mon père. Certes, le beau visage de
ma mère brillait encore de jeunesse ce soir-là où elle me tenait si
doucement les mains et cherchait à arrêter mes larmes; mais justement
il me semblait que cela n’aurait pas dû être, sa colère eût été moins
triste pour moi que cette douceur nouvelle que n’avait pas connue mon
enfance; il me semblait que je venais d’une main impie et secrète de
tracer dans son âme une première ride et d’y faire apparaître un
premier cheveu blanc. Cette pensée redoubla mes sanglots et alors je
vis maman, qui jamais ne se laissait aller à aucun attendrissement
avec moi, être tout d’un coup gagnée par le mien et essayer de retenir
une envie de pleurer. Comme elle sentit que je m’en étais aperçu, elle
me dit en riant: «Voilà mon petit jaunet, mon petit serin, qui va
rendre sa maman aussi bêtasse que lui, pour peu que cela continue.
Voyons, puisque tu n’as pas sommeil ni ta maman non plus, ne restons
pas à nous énerver, faisons quelque chose, prenons un de tes livres.»"

«anciens», comme si leur longue désuétude ayant effacé leur caractère
d’utilité, ils paraissaient plutôt disposés pour nous raconter la vie
des hommes d’autrefois que pour servir aux besoins de la nôtre. Elle
eût aimé que j’eusse dans ma chambre des photographies des monuments
ou des paysages les plus beaux. Mais au moment d’en faire l’emplette,
et bien que la chose représentée eût une valeur esthétique, elle
trouvait que la vulgarité, l’utilité reprenaient trop vite leur place
dans le mode mécanique de représentation, la photographie. Elle
essayait de ruser et sinon d’éliminer entièrement la banalité
commerciale, du moins de la réduire, d’y substituer pour la plus
grande partie de l’art encore, d’y introduire comme plusieurs
«épaisseurs» d’art: au lieu de photographies de la Cathédrale de
Chartres, des Grandes Eaux de Saint-Cloud, du Vésuve, elle se
renseignait auprès de Swann si quelque grand peintre ne les avait pas
représentés, et préférait me donner des photographies de la Cathédrale
de Chartres par Corot, des Grandes Eaux de Saint-Cloud par Hubert
Robert, du Vésuve par Turner, ce qui faisait un degré d’art de plus.
Mais si le photographe avait été écarté de la représentation du
chef-d’œuvre ou de la nature et remplacé par un grand artiste, il
reprenait ses droits pour reproduire cette interprétation même.
Arrivée à l’échéance de la vulgarité, ma grand’mère tâchait de la
reculer encore. Elle demandait à Swann si l’œuvre n’avait pas été
gravée, préférant, quand c’était possible, des gravures anciennes et
ayant encore un intérêt au delà d’elles-mêmes, par exemple celles qui
représentent un chef-d’œuvre dans un état où nous ne pouvons plus le
voir aujourd’hui (comme la gravure de la Cène de Léonard avant sa
dégradation, par Morgan). Il faut dire que les résultats de cette
manière de comprendre l’art de faire un cadeau ne furent pas toujours
très brillants. L’idée que je pris de Venise d’après un dessin du
Titien qui est censé avoir pour fond la lagune, était certainement
beaucoup moins exacte que celle que m’eussent donnée de simples
photographies. On ne pouvait plus faire le compte à la maison, quand
ma grand’tante voulait dresser un réquisitoire contre ma grand’mère,
des fauteuils offerts par elle à de jeunes fiancés ou à de vieux
époux, qui, à la première tentative qu’on avait faite pour s’en
servir, s’étaient immédiatement effondrés sous le poids d’un des
destinataires. Mais ma grand’mère aurait cru mesquin de trop s’occuper
de la solidité d’une boiserie où se distinguaient encore une
fleurette, un sourire, quelquefois une belle imagination du passé.
Même ce qui dans ces meubles répondait à un besoin, comme c’était
d’une façon à laquelle nous ne sommes plus habitués, la charmait comme
les vieilles manières de dire où nous voyons une métaphore, effacée,
dans notre moderne langage, par l’usure de l’habitude. Or, justement,
les romans champêtres de George Sand qu’elle me donnait pour ma fête,
étaient pleins ainsi qu’un mobilier ancien, d’expressions tombées en
désuétude et redevenues imagées, comme on n’en trouve plus qu’à la
campagne. Et ma grand’mère les avait achetés de préférence à d’autres
comme elle eût loué plus volontiers une propriété où il y aurait eu un
pigeonnier gothique ou quelqu’une de ces vieilles choses qui exercent
sur l’esprit une heureuse influence en lui donnant la nostalgie
d’impossibles voyages dans le temps."

sonné Françoise, car, à Combray, une personne «qu’on ne connaissait
point» était un être aussi peu croyable qu’un dieu de la mythologie,
et de fait on ne se souvenait pas que, chaque fois que s’était
produite, dans la rue de Saint-Esprit ou sur la place, une de ces
apparitions stupéfiantes, des recherches bien conduites n’eussent pas
fini par réduire le personnage fabuleux aux proportions d’une
«personne qu’on connaissait», soit personnellement, soit
abstraitement, dans son état civil, en tant qu’ayant tel degré de
parenté avec des gens de Combray. C’était le fils de Mme  Sauton qui
rentrait du service, la nièce de l’abbé Perdreau qui sortait de
couvent, le frère du curé, percepteur à Châteaudun qui venait de
prendre sa retraite ou qui était venu passer les fêtes. On avait eu en
les apercevant l’émotion de croire qu’il y avait à Combray des gens
qu’on ne connaissait point simplement parce qu’on ne les avait pas
reconnus ou identifiés tout de suite. Et pourtant, longtemps à
l’avance, Mme  Sauton et le curé avaient prévenu qu’ils attendaient
leurs «voyageurs». Quand le soir, je montais, en rentrant, raconter
notre promenade à ma tante, si j’avais l’imprudence de lui dire que
nous avions rencontré près du Pont-Vieux, un homme que mon grand-père
ne connaissait pas: «Un homme que grand-père ne connaissait point,
s’écriait elle. Ah! je te crois bien!» Néanmoins un peu émue de cette
nouvelle, elle voulait en avoir le cœur net, mon grand-père était
mandé. «Qui donc est-ce que vous avez rencontré près du Pont-Vieux,
mon oncle? un homme que vous ne connaissiez point?»—«Mais si,
répondait mon grand-père, c’était Prosper le frère du jardinier de Mme
Bouillebœuf.»—«Ah! bien», disait ma tante, tranquillisée et un peu
rouge; haussant les épaules avec un sourire ironique, elle ajoutait:
«Aussi il me disait que vous aviez rencontré un homme que vous ne
connaissiez point!» Et on me recommandait d’être plus circonspect une
autre fois et de ne plus agiter ainsi ma tante par des paroles
irréfléchies. On connaissait tellement bien tout le monde, à Combray,
bêtes et gens, que si ma tante avait vu par hasard passer un chien
«qu’elle ne connaissait point», elle ne cessait d’y penser et de
consacrer à ce fait incompréhensible ses talents d’induction et ses
heures de liberté.

conviction, mais dans un but d’apaisement et pour que ma tante ne se
«fende pas la tête.»

encore les objets précieux venus à l’église de personnages qui étaient
pour moi presque des personnages de légende (la croix d’or travaillée
disait-on par saint Éloi et donnée par Dagobert, le tombeau des fils
de Louis le Germanique, en porphyre et en cuivre émaillé) à cause de
quoi je m’avançais dans l’église, quand nous gagnions nos chaises,
comme dans une vallée visitée des fées, où le paysan s’émerveille de
voir dans un rocher, dans un arbre, dans une mare, la trace palpable
de leur passage surnaturel, tout cela faisait d’elle pour moi quelque
chose d’entièrement différent du reste de la ville: un édifice
occupant, si l’on peut dire, un espace à quatre dimensions—la
quatrième étant celle du Temps,—déployant à travers les siècles son
vaisseau qui, de travée en travée, de chapelle en chapelle, semblait
vaincre et franchir non pas seulement quelques mètres, mais des
époques successives d’où il sortait victorieux; dérobant le rude et
farouche XIe siècle dans l’épaisseur de ses murs, d’où il
n’apparaissait avec ses lourds cintres bouchés et aveuglés de
grossiers moellons que par la profonde entaille que creusait près du
porche l’escalier du clocher, et, même là, dissimulé par les
gracieuses arcades gothiques qui se pressaient coquettement devant lui
comme de plus grandes sœurs, pour le cacher aux étrangers, se placent
en souriant devant un jeune frère rustre, grognon et mal vêtu; élevant
dans le ciel au-dessus de la Place, sa tour qui avait contemplé saint
Louis et semblait le voir encore; et s’enfonçant avec sa crypte dans
une nuit mérovingienne où, nous guidant à tâtons sous la voûte obscure
et puissamment nervurée comme la membrane d’une immense chauve-souris
de pierre, Théodore et sa sœur nous éclairaient d’une bougie le
tombeau de la petite fille de Sigebert, sur lequel une profonde
valve,—comme la trace d’un fossile,—avait été creusée, disait-on, «par
une lampe de cristal qui, le soir du meurtre de la princesse franque,
s’était détachée d’elle-même des chaînes d’or où elle était suspendue
à la place de l’actuelle abside, et, sans que le cristal se brisât,
sans que la flamme s’éteignît, s’était enfoncée dans la pierre et
l’avait fait mollement céder sous elle.»


L’abside de l’église de Combray, peut-on vraiment en parler? Elle
était si grossière, si dénuée de beauté artistique et même d’élan
religieux. Du dehors, comme le croisement des rues sur lequel elle
donnait était en contre-bas, sa grossière muraille s’exhaussait d’un
soubassement en moellons nullement polis, hérissés de cailloux, et qui
n’avait rien de particulièrement ecclésiastique, les verrières
semblaient percées à une hauteur excessive, et le tout avait plus
l’air d’un mur de prison que d’église. Et certes, plus tard, quand je
me rappelais toutes les glorieuses absides que j’ai vues, il ne me
serait jamais venu à la pensée de rapprocher d’elles l’abside de
Combray. Seulement, un jour, au détour d’une petite rue provinciale,
j’aperçus, en face du croisement de trois ruelles, une muraille fruste
et surélevée, avec des verrières percées en haut et offrant le même
aspect asymétrique que l’abside de Combray. Alors je ne me suis pas
demandé comme à Chartres ou à Reims avec quelle puissance y était
exprimé le sentiment religieux, mais je me suis involontairement
écrié: «L’Église!»


L’église! Familière; mitoyenne, rue Saint-Hilaire, où était sa porte
nord, de ses deux voisines, la pharmacie de M. Rapin et la maison de
Mme  Loiseau, qu’elle touchait sans aucune séparation; simple citoyenne
de Combray qui aurait pu avoir son numéro dans la rue si les rues de
Combray avaient eu des numéros, et où il semble que le facteur aurait
dû s’arrêter le matin quand il faisait sa distribution, avant d’entrer
chez Mme  Loiseau et en sortant de chez M. Rapin, il y avait pourtant
entre elle et tout ce qui n’était pas elle une démarcation que mon
esprit n’a jamais pu arriver à franchir. Mme  Loiseau avait beau avoir
à sa fenêtre des fuchsias, qui prenaient la mauvaise habitude de
laisser leurs branches courir toujours partout tête baissée, et dont
les fleurs n’avaient rien de plus pressé, quand elles étaient assez
grandes, que d’aller rafraîchir leurs joues violettes et
congestionnées contre la sombre façade de l’église, les fuchsias ne
devenaient pas sacrés pour cela pour moi; entre les fleurs et la
pierre noircie sur laquelle elles s’appuyaient, si mes yeux ne
percevaient pas d’intervalle, mon esprit réservait un abîme.

soir au lundi matin. C’était un de ces hommes qui, en dehors d’une
carrière scientifique où ils ont d’ailleurs brillamment réussi,
possèdent une culture toute différente, littéraire, artistique, que
leur spécialisation professionnelle n’utilise pas et dont profite leur

d’Eulalie. Il n’y a vraiment qu’elle qui pourra me dire cela.»


Eulalie était une fille boiteuse, active et sourde qui s’était
«retirée» après la mort de Mme  de la Bretonnerie où elle avait été en
place depuis son enfance et qui avait pris à côté de l’église une
chambre, d’où elle descendait tout le temps soit aux offices, soit, en
dehors des offices, dire une petite prière ou donner un coup de main à
Théodore; le reste du temps elle allait voir des personnes malades
comme ma tante Léonie à qui elle racontait ce qui s’était passé à la
messe ou aux vêpres. Elle ne dédaignait pas d’ajouter quelque casuel à
la petite rente que lui servait la famille de ses anciens maîtres en
allant de temps en temps visiter le linge du curé ou de quelque autre
personnalité marquante du monde clérical de Combray. Elle portait
au-dessus d’une mante de drap noir un petit béguin blanc, presque de
religieuse, et une maladie de peau donnait à une partie de ses joues
et à son nez recourbé, les tons rose vif de la balsamine. Ses visites
étaient la grande distraction de ma tante Léonie qui ne recevait plus
guère personne d’autre, en dehors de M. le Curé. Ma tante avait peu à
peu évincé tous les autres visiteurs parce qu’ils avaient le tort à
ses yeux de rentrer tous dans l’une ou l’autre des deux catégories de
gens qu’elle détestait. Les uns, les pires et dont elle s’était
débarrassée les premiers, étaient ceux qui lui conseillaient de ne pas
«s’écouter» et professaient, fût-ce négativement et en ne la
manifestant que par certains silences de désapprobation ou par
certains sourires de doute, la doctrine subversive qu’une petite
promenade au soleil et un bon bifteck saignant (quand elle gardait
quatorze heures sur l’estomac deux méchantes gorgées d’eau de Vichy!)
lui feraient plus de bien que son lit et ses médecines. L’autre
catégorie se composait des personnes qui avaient l’air de croire
qu’elle était plus gravement malade qu’elle ne pensait, était aussi
gravement malade qu’elle le disait. Aussi, ceux qu’elle avait laissé
monter après quelques hésitations et sur les officieuses instances de
Françoise et qui, au cours de leur visite, avaient montré combien ils
étaient indignes de la faveur qu’on leur faisait en risquant
timidement un: «Ne croyez-vous pas que si vous vous secouiez un peu
par un beau temps», ou qui, au contraire, quand elle leur avait dit:
«Je suis bien bas, bien bas, c’est la fin, mes pauvres amis», lui
avaient répondu: «Ah! quand on n’a pas la santé! Mais vous pouvez
durer encore comme ça», ceux-là, les uns comme les autres, étaient
sûrs de ne plus jamais être reçus. Et si Françoise s’amusait de l’air
épouvanté de ma tante quand de son lit elle avait aperçu dans la rue
du Saint-Esprit une de ces personnes qui avait l’air de venir chez
elle ou quand elle avait entendu un coup de sonnette, elle riait
encore bien plus, et comme d’un bon tour, des ruses toujours
victorieuses de ma tante pour arriver à les faire congédier et de leur
mine déconfite en s’en retournant sans l’avoir vue, et, au fond
admirait sa maîtresse qu’elle jugeait supérieure à tous ces gens
puisqu’elle ne voulait pas les recevoir. En somme, ma tante exigeait
à la fois qu’on l’approuvât dans son régime, qu’on la plaignît pour
ses souffrances et qu’on la rassurât sur son avenir.


C’est à quoi Eulalie excellait. Ma tante pouvait lui dire vingt fois
en une minute: «C’est la fin, ma pauvre Eulalie», vingt fois Eulalie
répondait: «Connaissant votre maladie comme vous la connaissez, madame
Octave, vous irez à cent ans, comme me disait hier encore Mme
Sazerin.» (Une des plus fermes croyances d’Eulalie et que le nombre
imposant des démentis apportés par l’expérience n’avait pas suffi à
entamer, était que Mme  Sazerat s’appelait Mme  Sazerin.)

spectacles qu’elle annonçait. Rien n’était plus désintéressé et plus

annoncée et qui étaient conditionnés à la fois par les images
inséparables des mots qui en composaient le titre et aussi de la
couleur des affiches encore humides et boursouflées de colle sur

consacrent leur générosité, leur talent, un rêve disponible de beauté
sentimentale—car, comme les artistes, elles ne le réalisent pas, ne le

leur coûte peu, à enrichir d’un sertissage précieux et fin la vie
fruste et mal dégrossie des hommes. Comme celle-ci, dans le fumoir où

conduisit jusqu’à l’antichambre. Éperdu d’amour pour la dame en rose,
je couvris de baisers fous les joues pleines de tabac de mon vieil
oncle, et tandis qu’avec assez d’embarras il me laissait entendre sans
oser me le dire ouvertement qu’il aimerait autant que je ne parlasse
pas de cette visite à mes parents, je lui disais, les larmes aux yeux,
que le souvenir de sa bonté était en moi si fort que je trouverais
bien un jour le moyen de lui témoigner ma reconnaissance. Il était si
fort en effet que deux heures plus tard, après quelques phrases
mystérieuses et qui ne me parurent pas donner à mes parents une idée
assez nette de la nouvelle importance dont j’étais doué, je trouvai
plus explicite de leur raconter dans les moindres détails la visite
que je venais de faire. Je ne croyais pas ainsi causer d’ennuis à mon
oncle. Comment l’aurais-je cru, puisque je ne le désirais pas. Et je
ne pouvais supposer que mes parents trouveraient du mal dans une
visite où je n’en trouvais pas. N’arrive-t-il pas tous les jours qu’un
ami nous demande de ne pas manquer de l’excuser auprès d’une femme à
qui il a été empêché d’écrire, et que nous négligions de le faire
jugeant que cette personne ne peut pas attacher d’importance à un
silence qui n’en a pas pour nous? Je m’imaginais, comme tout le monde,
que le cerveau des autres était un réceptacle inerte et docile, sans
pouvoir de réaction spécifique sur ce qu’on y introduisait; et je ne
doutais pas qu’en déposant dans celui de mes parents la nouvelle de la
connaissance que mon oncle m’avait fait faire, je ne leur transmisse
en même temps comme je le souhaitais, le jugement bienveillant que je
portais sur cette présentation. Mes parents malheureusement s’en
remirent à des principes entièrement différents de ceux que je leur
suggérais d’adopter, quand ils voulurent apprécier l’action de mon
oncle. Mon père et mon grand-père eurent avec lui des explications
violentes; j’en fus indirectement informé. Quelques jours après,
croisant dehors mon oncle qui passait en voiture découverte, je
ressentis la douleur, la reconnaissance, le remords que j’aurais voulu
lui exprimer. A côté de leur immensité, je trouvai qu’un coup de
chapeau serait mesquin et pourrait faire supposer à mon oncle que je
ne me croyais pas tenu envers lui à plus qu’à une banale politesse. Je
résolus de m’abstenir de ce geste insuffisant et je détournai la tête.
Mon oncle pensa que je suivais en cela les ordres de mes parents, il
ne le leur pardonna pas, et il est mort bien des années après sans
qu’aucun de nous l’ait jamais revu.

d’incessants mouvements du dedans au dehors, vers la découverte de la
vérité, venaient les émotions que me donnait l’action à laquelle je
prenais part, car ces après-midi-là étaient plus remplis d’événements
dramatiques que ne l’est souvent toute une vie. C’était les événements
qui survenaient dans le livre que je lisais; il est vrai que les
personnages qu’ils affectaient n’étaient pas «Réels», comme disait
Françoise. Mais tous les sentiments que nous font éprouver la joie ou
l’infortune d’un personnage réel ne se produisent en nous que par
l’intermédiaire d’une image de cette joie ou de cette infortune;
l’ingéniosité du premier romancier consista à comprendre que dans
l’appareil de nos émotions, l’image étant le seul élément essentiel,
la simplification qui consisterait à supprimer purement et simplement
les personnages réels serait un perfectionnement décisif. Un être
réel, si profondément que nous sympathisions avec lui, pour une grande
part est perçu par nos sens, c’est-à-dire nous reste opaque, offre un
poids mort que notre sensibilité ne peut soulever. Qu’un malheur le
frappe, ce n’est qu’en une petite partie de la notion totale que nous
avons de lui, que nous pourrons en être émus; bien plus, ce n’est
qu’en une partie de la notion totale qu’il a de soi qu’il pourra
l’être lui-même. La trouvaille du romancier a été d’avoir l’idée de
remplacer ces parties impénétrables à l’âme par une quantité égale de
parties immatérielles, c’est-à-dire que notre âme peut s’assimiler.
Qu’importe dès lors que les actions, les émotions de ces êtres d’un
nouveau genre nous apparaissent comme vraies, puisque nous les avons
faites nôtres, puisque c’est en nous qu’elles se produisent, qu’elles
tiennent sous leur dépendance, tandis que nous tournons fiévreusement
les pages du livre, la rapidité de notre respiration et l’intensité de
notre regard. Et une fois que le romancier nous a mis dans cet état,
où comme dans tous les états purement intérieurs, toute émotion est
décuplée, où son livre va nous troubler à la façon d’un rêve mais d’un
rêve plus clair que ceux que nous avons en dormant et dont le souvenir
durera davantage, alors, voici qu’il déchaîne en nous pendant une
heure tous les bonheurs et tous les malheurs possibles dont nous
mettrions dans la vie des années à connaître quelques-uns, et dont les
plus intenses ne nous seraient jamais révélés parce que la lenteur
avec laquelle ils se produisent nous en ôte la perception; (ainsi
notre cœur change, dans la vie, et c’est la pire douleur; mais nous ne
la connaissons que dans la lecture, en imagination: dans la réalité il
change, comme certains phénomènes de la nature se produisent, assez
lentement pour que, si nous pouvons constater successivement chacun de
ses états différents, en revanche la sensation même du changement nous
soit épargnée).


Déjà moins intérieur à mon corps que cette vie des personnages, venait
ensuite, à demi projeté devant moi, le paysage où se déroulait
l’action et qui exerçait sur ma pensée une bien plus grande influence
que l’autre, que celui que j’avais sous les yeux quand je les levais
du livre. C’est ainsi que pendant deux étés, dans la chaleur du jardin
de Combray, j’ai eu, à cause du livre que je lisais alors, la
nostalgie d’un pays montueux et fluviatile, où je verrais beaucoup de
scieries et où, au fond de l’eau claire, des morceaux de bois
pourrissaient sous des touffes de cresson: non loin montaient le long
de murs bas, des grappes de fleurs violettes et rougeâtres. Et comme
le rêve d’une femme qui m’aurait aimé était toujours présent à ma
pensée, ces étés-là ce rêve fut imprégné de la fraîcheur des eaux
courantes; et quelle que fût la femme que j’évoquais, des grappes de
fleurs violettes et rougeâtres s’élevaient aussitôt de chaque côté
d’elle comme des couleurs complémentaires.

visiter la région qu’il décrivait, j’aurais cru faire un pas
inestimable dans la conquête de la vérité. Car si on a la sensation
d’être toujours entouré de son âme, ce n’est pas comme d’une prison
immobile: plutôt on est comme emporté avec elle dans un perpétuel élan
pour la dépasser, pour atteindre à l’extérieur, avec une sorte de
découragement, entendant toujours autour de soi cette sonorité
identique qui n’est pas écho du dehors mais retentissement d’une
vibration interne. On cherche à retrouver dans les choses, devenues
par là précieuses, le reflet que notre âme a projeté sur elles; on est
déçu en constatant qu’elles semblent dépourvues dans la nature, du
charme qu’elles devaient, dans notre pensée, au voisinage de certaines
idées; parfois on convertit toutes les forces de cette âme en
habileté, en splendeur pour agir sur des êtres dont nous sentons bien
qu’ils sont situés en dehors de nous et que nous ne les atteindrons
jamais. Aussi, si j’imaginais toujours autour de la femme que
j’aimais, les lieux que je désirais le plus alors, si j’eusse voulu
que ce fût elle qui me les fît visiter, qui m’ouvrît l’accès d’un
monde inconnu, ce n’était pas par le hasard d’une simple association
de pensée; non, c’est que mes rêves de voyage et d’amour n’étaient que
des moments—que je sépare artificiellement aujourd’hui comme si je
pratiquais des sections à des hauteurs différentes d’un jet d’eau
irisé et en apparence immobile—dans un même et infléchissable

demandant des explications, le trouble où il m’avait jeté quand il
m’avait dit que les beaux vers (à moi qui n’attendais d’eux rien moins
que la révélation de la vérité) étaient d’autant plus beaux qu’ils ne
signifiaient rien du tout. Bloch en effet ne fut pas réinvité à la
maison. Il y avait d’abord été bien accueilli. Mon grand-père, il est
vrai, prétendait que chaque fois que je me liais avec un de mes
camarades plus qu’avec les autres et que je l’amenais chez nous,
c’était toujours un juif, ce qui ne lui eût pas déplu en principe—même
son ami Swann était d’origine juive—s’il n’avait trouvé que ce n’était
pas d’habitude parmi les meilleurs que je le choisissais. Aussi quand
j’amenais un nouvel ami il était bien rare qu’il ne fredonnât pas: «O
Dieu de nos Pères» de la Juive ou bien «Israël romps ta chaîne», ne
chantant que l’air naturellement (Ti la lam ta lam, talim), mais
j’avais peur que mon camarade ne le connût et ne rétablît les paroles.


Avant de les avoir vus, rien qu’en entendant leur nom qui, bien
souvent, n’avait rien de particulièrement israélite, il devinait non
seulement l’origine juive de ceux de mes amis qui l’étaient en effet,
mais même ce qu’il y avait quelquefois de fâcheux dans leur famille.


—«Et comment s’appelle-t-il ton ami qui vient ce soir?»


—«Dumont, grand-père.»


—«Dumont! Oh! je me méfie.»


Et il chantait:


«Archers, faites bonne garde!
Veillez sans trêve et sans bruit»;


Et après nous avoir posé adroitement quelques questions plus précises,
il s’écriait: «À la garde! À la garde!» ou, si c’était le patient
lui-même déjà arrivé qu’il avait forcé à son insu, par un
interrogatoire dissimulé, à confesser ses origines, alors pour nous
montrer qu’il n’avait plus aucun doute, il se contentait de nous
regarder en fredonnant imperceptiblement:


«De ce timide Israëlite
Quoi! vous guidez ici les pas!»


ou:


«Champs paternels, Hébron, douce vallée.»


ou encore:


«Oui, je suis de la race élue.»


Ces petites manies de mon grand-père n’impliquaient aucun sentiment
malveillant à l’endroit de mes camarades. Mais Bloch avait déplu à mes
parents pour d’autres raisons. Il avait commencé par agacer mon père
qui, le voyant mouillé, lui avait dit avec intérêt:


—«Mais, monsieur Bloch, quel temps fait-il donc, est-ce qu’il a plu?
Je n’y comprends rien, le baromètre était excellent.»


Il n’en avait tiré que cette réponse:


—«Monsieur, je ne puis absolument vous dire s’il a plu. Je vis si
résolument en dehors des contingences physiques que mes sens ne
prennent pas la peine de me les notifier.»


—«Mais, mon pauvre fils, il est idiot ton ami, m’avait dit mon père
quand Bloch fut parti. Comment! il ne peut même pas me dire le temps
qu’il fait! Mais il n’y a rien de plus intéressant! C’est un imbécile.


Puis Bloch avait déplu à ma grand’mère parce que, après le déjeuner
comme elle disait qu’elle était un peu souffrante, il avait étouffé un
sanglot et essuyé des larmes.


—«Comment veux-tu que ça soit sincère, me dit-elle, puisqu’il ne me
connaît pas; ou bien alors il est fou.»


Et enfin il avait mécontenté tout le monde parce que, étant venu
déjeuner une heure et demie en retard et couvert de boue, au lieu de
s’excuser, il avait dit:


—«Je ne me laisse jamais influencer par les perturbations de
l’atmosphère ni par les divisions conventionnelles du temps. Je
réhabiliterais volontiers l’usage de la pipe d’opium et du kriss
malais, mais j’ignore celui de ces instruments infiniment plus
pernicieux et d’ailleurs platement bourgeois, la montre et le
parapluie.»


Il serait malgré tout revenu à Combray. Il n’était pas pourtant l’ami
que mes parents eussent souhaité pour moi; ils avaient fini par penser
que les larmes que lui avait fait verser l’indisposition de ma
grand’mère n’étaient pas feintes; mais ils savaient d’instinct ou par
expérience que les élans de notre sensibilité ont peu d’empire sur la
suite de nos actes et la conduite de notre vie, et que le respect des
obligations morales, la fidélité aux amis, l’exécution d’une œuvre,
l’observance d’un régime, ont un fondement plus sûr dans des habitudes
aveugles que dans ces transports momentanés, ardents et stériles. Ils
auraient préféré pour moi à Bloch des compagnons qui ne me donneraient
pas plus qu’il n’est convenu d’accorder à ses amis, selon les règles
de la morale bourgeoise; qui ne m’enverraient pas inopinément une
corbeille de fruits parce qu’ils auraient ce jour-là pensé à moi avec
tendresse, mais qui, n’étant pas capables de faire pencher en ma
faveur la juste balance des devoirs et des exigences de l’amitié sur
un simple mouvement de leur imagination et de leur sensibilité, ne la
fausseraient pas davantage à mon préjudice. Nos torts même font
difficilement départir de ce qu’elles nous doivent ces natures dont ma
grand’tante était le modèle, elle qui brouillée depuis des années avec
une nièce à qui elle ne parlait jamais, ne modifia pas pour cela le
testament où elle lui laissait toute sa fortune, parce que c’était sa
plus proche parente et que cela «se devait»."

accouchement, le traintrain de ma tante ne subissait jamais aucune
variation, je ne parle pas de celles qui, se répétant toujours
identiques à des intervalles réguliers, n’introduisaient au sein de
l’uniformité qu’une sorte d’uniformité secondaire. C’est ainsi que
tous les samedis, comme Françoise allait dans l’après-midi au marché
de Roussainville-le-Pin, le déjeuner était, pour tout le monde, une
heure plus tôt. Et ma tante avait si bien pris l’habitude de cette
dérogation hebdomadaire à ses habitudes, qu’elle tenait à cette
habitude-là autant qu’aux autres. Elle y était si bien «routinée»,
comme disait Françoise, que s’il lui avait fallu un samedi, attendre
pour déjeuner l’heure habituelle, cela l’eût autant «dérangée» que si
elle avait dû, un autre jour, avancer son déjeuner à l’heure du
samedi. Cette avance du déjeuner donnait d’ailleurs au samedi, pour
nous tous, une figure particulière, indulgente, et assez sympathique.
Au moment où d’habitude on a encore une heure à vivre avant la détente
du repas, on savait que, dans quelques secondes, on allait voir
arriver des endives précoces, une omelette de faveur, un bifteck
immérité. Le retour de ce samedi asymétrique était un de ces petits
événements intérieurs, locaux, presque civiques qui, dans les vies
tranquilles et les sociétés fermées, créent une sorte de lien national
et deviennent le thème favori des conversations, des plaisanteries,
des récits exagérés à plaisir: il eût été le noyau tout prêt pour un
cycle légendaire si l’un de nous avait eu la tête épique. Dès le
matin, avant d’être habillés, sans raison, pour le plaisir d’éprouver
la force de la solidarité, on se disait les uns aux autres avec bonne
humeur, avec cordialité, avec patriotisme: «Il n’y a pas de temps à
perdre, n’oublions pas que c’est samedi!» cependant que ma tante,
conférant avec Françoise et songeant que la journée serait plus longue
que d’habitude, disait: «Si vous leur faisiez un beau morceau de veau,
comme c’est samedi.» Si à dix heures et demie un distrait tirait sa
montre en disant: «Allons, encore une heure et demie avant le
déjeuner», chacun était enchanté d’avoir à lui dire: «Mais voyons, à
quoi pensez-vous, vous oubliez que c’est samedi!»; on en riait encore
un quart d’heure après et on se promettait de monter raconter cet
oubli à ma tante pour l’amuser. Le visage du ciel même semblait
changé. Après le déjeuner, le soleil, conscient"

femme et un héritage qu’il avait fait, il s’était retiré auprès de
Combray, on le recevait souvent à la maison. Mais d’une pudibonderie
excessive, il cessa de venir pour ne pas rencontrer Swann qui avait
fait ce qu’il appelait «un mariage déplacé, dans le goût du jour». Ma
mère, ayant appris qu’il composait, lui avait dit par amabilité que,
quand elle irait le voir, il faudrait qu’il lui fît entendre quelque
chose de lui. M. Vinteuil en aurait eu beaucoup de joie, mais il
poussait la politesse et la bonté jusqu’à de tels scrupules que, se
mettant toujours à la place des autres, il craignait de les ennuyer et
de leur paraître égoïste s’il suivait ou seulement laissait deviner
son désir. Le jour où mes parents étaient allés chez lui en visite, je
les avais accompagnés, mais ils m’avaient permis de rester dehors et,
comme la maison de M. Vinteuil, Montjouvain, était en contre-bas d’un
monticule buissonneux, où je m’étais caché, je m’étais trouvé de
plain-pied avec le salon du second étage, à cinquante centimètres de
la fenêtre. Quand on était venu lui annoncer mes parents, j’avais vu
M. Vinteuil se hâter de mettre en évidence sur le piano un morceau de
musique. Mais une fois mes parents entrés, il l’avait retiré et mis
dans un coin. Sans doute avait-il craint de leur laisser supposer
qu’il n’était heureux de les voir que pour leur jouer de ses
compositions. Et chaque fois que ma mère était revenue à la charge au
cours de la visite, il avait répété plusieurs fois «Mais je ne sais
qui a mis cela sur le piano, ce n’est pas sa place», et avait détourné
la conversation sur d’autres sujets, justement parce que ceux-là
l’intéressaient moins. Sa seule passion était pour sa fille et
celle-ci qui avait l’air d’un garçon paraissait si robuste qu’on ne
pouvait s’empêcher de sourire en voyant les précautions que son père
prenait pour elle, ayant toujours des châles supplémentaires à lui
jeter sur les épaules. Ma grand’mère faisait remarquer quelle
expression douce délicate, presque timide passait souvent dans les
regards de cette enfant si rude, dont le visage était semé de taches
de son. Quand elle venait de prononcer une parole elle l’entendait
avec l’esprit de ceux à qui elle l’avait dite, s’alarmait des
malentendus possibles et on voyait s’éclairer, se découper comme par
transparence, sous la figure hommasse du «bon diable», les traits plus
fins d’une jeune fille éplorée."

sur la rencontre de Legrandin, je descendis à la cuisine, était un de
ceux où la Charité de Giotto, très malade de son accouchement récent,
ne pouvait se lever; Françoise, n’étant plus aidée, était en retard.
Quand je fus en bas, elle était en train, dans l’arrière-cuisine qui
donnait sur la basse-cour, de tuer un poulet qui, par sa résistance
désespérée et bien naturelle, mais accompagnée par Françoise hors
d’elle, tandis qu’elle cherchait à lui fendre le cou sous l’oreille,
des cris de «sale bête! sale bête!», mettait la sainte douceur et
l’onction de notre servante un peu moins en lumière qu’il n’eût fait,
au dîner du lendemain, par sa peau brodée d’or comme une chasuble et
son jus précieux égoutté d’un ciboire. Quand il fut mort, Françoise
recueillit le sang qui coulait sans noyer sa rancune, eut encore un
sursaut de colère, et regardant le cadavre de son ennemi, dit une
dernière fois: «Sale bête!» Je remontai tout tremblant; j’aurais voulu
qu’on mît Françoise tout de suite à la porte. Mais qui m’eût fait des
boules aussi chaudes, du café aussi parfumé, et même... ces
poulets?... Et en réalité, ce lâche calcul, tout le monde avait eu à
le faire comme moi. Car ma tante Léonie savait,—ce que j’ignorais
encore,—que Françoise qui, pour sa fille, pour ses neveux, aurait
donné sa vie sans une plainte, était pour d’autres êtres d’une dureté
singulière. Malgré cela ma tante l’avait gardée, car si elle
connaissait sa cruauté, elle appréciait son service. Je m’aperçus peu
à peu que la douceur, la componction, les vertus de Françoise
cachaient des tragédies d’arrière-cuisine, comme l’histoire découvre
que les règnes des Rois et des Reines, qui sont représentés les mains
jointes dans les vitraux des églises, furent marqués d’incidents
sanglants. Je me rendis compte que, en dehors de ceux de sa parenté,
les humains excitaient d’autant plus sa pitié par leurs malheurs,
qu’ils vivaient plus éloignés d’elle. Les torrents de larmes qu’elle
versait en lisant le journal sur les infortunes des inconnus se
tarissaient vite si elle pouvait se représenter la personne qui en
était l’objet d’une façon un peu précise. Une de ces nuits qui
suivirent l’accouchement de la fille de cuisine, celle-ci fut prise
d’atroces coliques; maman l’entendit se plaindre, se leva et réveilla
Françoise qui, insensible, déclara que tous ces cris étaient une
comédie, qu’elle voulait «faire la maîtresse». Le médecin, qui
craignait ces crises, avait mis un signet, dans un livre de médecine
que nous avions, à la page où elles sont décrites et où il nous avait
dit de nous reporter pour trouver l’indication des premiers soins à
donner. Ma mère envoya Françoise chercher le livre en lui recommandant
de ne pas laisser tomber le signet. Au bout d’une heure, Françoise
n’était pas revenue; ma mère indignée crut qu’elle s’était recouchée
et me dit d’aller voir moi-même dans la bibliothèque. J’y trouvai
Françoise qui, ayant voulu regarder ce que le signet marquait, lisait
la description clinique de la crise et poussait des sanglots
maintenant qu’il s’agissait d’une malade-type qu’elle ne connaissait
pas. A chaque symptôme douloureux mentionné par l’auteur du traité,
elle s’écriait: «Hé là! Sainte Vierge, est-il possible que le bon Dieu
veuille faire souffrir ainsi une malheureuse créature humaine? Hé! la
pauvre!»


Mais dès que je l’eus appelée et qu’elle fut revenue près du lit de la
Charité de Giotto, ses larmes cessèrent aussitôt de couler; elle ne
put reconnaître ni cette agréable sensation de pitié et
d’attendrissement qu’elle connaissait bien et que la lecture des
journaux lui avait souvent donnée, ni aucun plaisir de même famille,
dans l’ennui et dans l’irritation de s’être levée au milieu de la nuit
pour la fille de cuisine; et à la vue des mêmes souffrances dont la
description l’avait fait pleurer, elle n’eut plus que des
ronchonnements de mauvaise humeur, même d’affreux sarcasmes, disant,
quand elle crut que nous étions partis et ne pouvions plus l’entendre:
«Elle n’avait qu’à ne pas faire ce qu’il faut pour ça! ça lui a fait
plaisir! qu’elle ne fasse pas de manières maintenant. Faut-il tout de
même qu’un garçon ait été abandonné du bon Dieu pour aller avec ça.
Ah! c’est bien comme on disait dans le patois de ma pauvre mère:


«Qui du cul d’un chien s’amourose


«Il lui paraît une rose.»


Si, quand son petit-fils était un peu enrhumé du cerveau, elle partait
la nuit, même malade, au lieu de se coucher, pour voir s’il n’avait
besoin de rien, faisant quatre lieues à pied avant le jour afin d’être
rentrée pour son travail, en revanche ce même amour des siens et son
désir d’assurer la grandeur future de sa maison se traduisait dans sa
politique à l’égard des autres domestiques par une maxime constante
qui fut de n’en jamais laisser un seul s’implanter chez ma tante,
qu’elle mettait d’ailleurs une sorte d’orgueil à ne laisser approcher
par personne, préférant, quand elle-même était malade, se relever pour
lui donner son eau de Vichy plutôt que de permettre l’accès de la
chambre de sa maîtresse à la fille de cuisine. Et comme cet
hyménoptère observé par Fabre, la guêpe fouisseuse, qui pour que ses
petits après sa mort aient de la viande fraîche à manger, appelle
l’anatomie au secours de sa cruauté et, ayant capturé des charançons
et des araignées, leur perce avec un savoir et une adresse merveilleux
le centre nerveux d’où dépend le mouvement des pattes, mais non les
autres fonctions de la vie, de façon que l’insecte paralysé près
duquel elle dépose ses œufs, fournisse aux larves, quand elles
écloront un gibier docile, inoffensif, incapable de fuite ou de
résistance, mais nullement faisandé, Françoise trouvait pour servir sa
volonté permanente de rendre la maison intenable à tout domestique,
des ruses si savantes et si impitoyables que, bien des années plus
tard, nous apprîmes que si cet été-là nous avions mangé presque tous
les jours des asperges, c’était parce que leur odeur donnait à la
pauvre fille de cuisine chargée de les éplucher des crises d’asthme
d’une telle violence qu’elle fut obligée de finir par s’en aller."

est-elle jolie!» En effet c’était une épine, mais rose, plus belle
encore que les blanches. Elle aussi avait une parure de fête,—de ces
seules vraies fêtes que sont les fêtes religieuses, puisqu’un caprice
contingent ne les applique pas comme les fêtes mondaines à un jour
quelconque qui ne leur est pas spécialement destiné, qui n’a rien
d’essentiellement férié,—mais une parure plus riche encore, car les
fleurs attachées sur la branche, les unes au-dessus des autres, de
manière à ne laisser aucune place qui ne fût décorée, comme des
pompons qui enguirlandent une houlette rococo, étaient «en couleur»,
par conséquent d’une qualité supérieure selon l’esthétique de Combray

Mon grand-père racontait ainsi notre promenade à ma tante Léonie, soit
pour la distraire, soit qu’on n’eût pas perdu tout espoir d’arriver à
la faire sortir. Or elle aimait beaucoup autrefois cette propriété, et
d’ailleurs les visites de Swann avaient été les dernières qu’elle
avait reçues, alors qu’elle fermait déjà sa porte à tout le monde. Et
de même que quand il venait maintenant prendre de ses nouvelles (elle
était la seule personne de chez nous qu’il demandât encore à voir),
elle lui faisait répondre qu’elle était fatiguée, mais qu’elle le
laisserait entrer la prochaine fois, de même elle dit ce soir-là:
«Oui, un jour qu’il fera beau, j’irai en voiture jusqu’à la porte du
parc.» C’est sincèrement qu’elle le disait. Elle eût aimé revoir Swann
et Tansonville; mais le désir qu’elle en avait suffisait à ce qui lui
restait de forces; sa réalisation les eût excédées. Quelquefois le
beau temps lui rendait un peu de vigueur, elle se levait, s’habillait;
la fatigue commençait avant qu’elle fût passée dans l’autre chambre et
elle réclamait son lit. Ce qui avait commencé pour elle—plus tôt
seulement que cela n’arrive d’habitude,—c’est ce grand renoncement de
la vieillesse qui se prépare à la mort, s’enveloppe dans sa
chrysalide, et qu’on peut observer, à la fin des vies qui se
prolongent tard, même entre les anciens amants qui se sont le plus
aimés, entre les amis unis par les liens les plus spirituels et qui à
partir d’une certaine année cessent de faire le voyage ou la sortie
nécessaire pour se voir, cessent de s’écrire et savent qu’ils ne
communiqueront plus en ce monde. Ma tante devait parfaitement savoir
qu’elle ne reverrait pas Swann, qu’elle ne quitterait plus jamais la
maison, mais cette réclusion définitive devait lui être rendue assez
aisée pour la raison même qui selon nous aurait dû la lui rendre plus
douloureuse: c’est que cette réclusion lui était imposée par la
diminution qu’elle pouvait constater chaque jour dans ses forces, et
qui, en faisant de chaque action, de chaque mouvement, une fatigue,

leurs feuilles qu’on ne peut confondre avec la feuille d’aucun autre
arbre fruitier, les pommiers ouvraient leurs larges pétales de satin
blanc ou suspendaient les timides bouquets de leurs rougissants
boutons. C’est du côté de Méséglise que j’ai remarqué pour la première

elle. J’aimais à retrouver son image dans des tableaux et dans des

pendant les premières années, avant que Bloch eût accoutumé mes yeux

paraîtrait belle aujourd’hui et où je ne l’eusse pas reconnue alors.

grande mare et adossée à un talus buissonneux que demeurait M.
Vinteuil. Aussi croisait-on souvent sur la route sa fille, conduisant
un buggy à toute allure. A partir d’une certaine année on ne la
rencontra plus seule, mais avec une amie plus âgée, qui avait mauvaise
réputation dans le pays et qui un jour s’installa définitivement à
Montjouvain. On disait: «Faut-il que ce pauvre M. Vinteuil soit
aveuglé par la tendresse pour ne pas s’apercevoir de ce qu’on raconte,
et permettre à sa fille, lui qui se scandalise d’une parole déplacée,
de faire vivre sous son toit une femme pareille. Il dit que c’est une
femme supérieure, un grand cœur et qu’elle aurait eu des dispositions
extraordinaires pour la musique si elle les avait cultivées. Il peut
être sûr que ce n’est pas de musique qu’elle s’occupe avec sa fille.»
M. Vinteuil le disait; et il est en effet remarquable combien une
personne excite toujours d’admiration pour ses qualités morales chez
les parents de toute autre personne avec qui elle a des relations
charnelles. L’amour physique, si injustement décrié, force tellement
tout être à manifester jusqu’aux moindres parcelles qu’il possède de
bonté, d’abandon de soi, qu’elles resplendissent jusqu’aux yeux de
l’entourage immédiat. Le docteur Percepied à qui sa grosse voix et ses
gros sourcils permettaient de tenir tant qu’il voulait le rôle de
perfide dont il n’avait pas le physique, sans compromettre en rien sa
réputation inébranlable et imméritée de bourru bienfaisant, savait
faire rire aux larmes le curé et tout le monde en disant d’un ton
rude: «Hé bien! il paraît qu’elle fait de la musique avec son amie,
Mlle  Vinteuil. Ça a l’air de vous étonner. Moi je sais pas. C’est le
père Vinteuil qui m’a encore dit ça hier. Après tout, elle a bien le
droit d’aimer la musique, c’te fille. Moi je ne suis pas pour
contrarier les vocations artistiques des enfants. Vinteuil non plus à
ce qu’il paraît. Et puis lui aussi il fait de la musique avec l’amie
de sa fille. Ah! sapristi on en fait une musique dans c’te boîte-là.
Mais qu’est-ce que vous avez à rire; mais ils font trop de musique ces
gens. L’autre jour j’ai rencontré le père Vinteuil près du cimetière.
Il ne tenait pas sur ses jambes.»


Pour ceux qui comme nous virent à cette époque M. Vinteuil éviter les
personnes qu’il connaissait, se détourner quand il les apercevait,
vieillir en quelques mois, s’absorber dans son chagrin, devenir
incapable de tout effort qui n’avait pas directement le bonheur de sa
fille pour but, passer des journées entières devant la tombe de sa
femme,—il eût été difficile de ne pas comprendre qu’il était en train
de mourir de chagrin, et de supposer qu’il ne se rendait pas compte
des propos qui couraient. Il les connaissait, peut-être même y
ajoutait-il foi. Il n’est peut-être pas une personne, si grande que
soit sa vertu, que la complexité des circonstances ne puisse amener à
vivre un jour dans la familiarité du vice qu’elle condamne le plus
formellement,—sans qu’elle le reconnaisse d’ailleurs tout à fait sous
le déguisement de faits particuliers qu’il revêt pour entrer en
contact avec elle et la faire souffrir: paroles bizarres, attitude
inexplicable, un certain soir, de tel être qu’elle a par ailleurs tant
de raisons pour aimer. Mais pour un homme comme M. Vinteuil il devait
entrer bien plus de souffrance que pour un autre dans la résignation à
une de ces situations qu’on croit à tort être l’apanage exclusif du
monde de la bohème: elles se produisent chaque fois qu’a besoin de se
réserver la place et la sécurité qui lui sont nécessaires, un vice que
la nature elle-même fait épanouir chez un enfant, parfois rien qu’en
mêlant les vertus de son père et de sa mère, comme la couleur de ses
yeux. Mais de ce que M. Vinteuil connaissait peut-être la conduite de
sa fille, il ne s’ensuit pas que son culte pour elle en eût été
diminué. Les faits ne pénètrent pas dans le monde où vivent nos
croyances, ils n’ont pas fait naître celles-ci, ils ne les détruisent
pas; ils peuvent leur infliger les plus constants démentis sans les
affaiblir, et une avalanche de malheurs ou de maladies se succédant
sans interruption dans une famille, ne la fera pas douter de la bonté
de son Dieu ou du talent de son médecin. "

The man before you looks so ordinary, so generic, that he might pass for a member of nearly any ethnic group in any country in the world. Well, perhaps he’d be most successful in the Mediterranean area; but you have an uneasy feeling that if he wore lederhosen or a silk kimono, or got a really deep tan, he’d still mingle unnoticed anywhere. He has bright, friendly little black eyes. He has a neat little black beard and moustache, like a cartoon devil.

  The text beside his image tells you his designation is JOSEPH, that he is a Facilitator Grade One, that his acquisition date was 18,145 B.C.E., (Gregorian) 25 November, at Irun del Mar, Basque Republic.

And worked in the New World too; here’s a mention of the trickster Coyote. And here’s a long, long list of work in the entertainment industry.

  The text states further that he was processed at Eurobase One, that his ethics programming is flexible, and that he has a disinformation capacity of ninety-eight percent, but you don’t really absorb this last bit because your mind is still grappling with the implications of his career.

  It wasn’t a long speech, no flowers of rhetoric such as Sarpa might have come up with. Budu just laid it out for them, simple and straight. From now on, they were all to live together in peace. They would intermarry and have children. There would be no more cannibalism. There would be no more fighting. The penalty for disobedience would be death.

  Then Budu told them that we were going, and they were to bury what we’d left them of their dead. He warned them, though, that we were only going up the mountain, above the tree line into the mist, and we’d be watching them always from the high places.

  And we did. We were up here thirty years. It turned out to be a good thing for us, too, because while we were overseeing the integration of the two tribes, Budu worked out a proposal for our masters. I told you he’d studied their future history. He knew what kind of an opening they needed, and he gave them one. He pointed out the nearly universal existence of places we could fit in the mortals’ mythology. Not just of your village, mortal; every village there is, anywhere.

  Legends of gods, or giants or trolls or demons, who live up somewhere high and bring judgment on mankind. Sometimes terrible, sometimes benign, but not to be screwed with, ever! Sometimes they’re supposed to live on one specific mountain, like this one; sometimes the story gets garbled and they’re thought to live in the clouds, or the sky. Someplace up. Hell, there’s even a story about a big man with a beard who lives at the North Pole, who rewards and punishes children. I think he’s called Satan… or was it Nobodaddy? It doesn’t matter.

  Anyway, Budu showed our masters that his proposal fit right in with recorded history, was in fact vital to the development of mortal religion. And, while I understand they don’t approve of religion much up there in the future, they do like to be absolutely sure that history rolls along smoothly. Messing with causality scares them.

  What was his proposal, mortal? Come on, can’t you think? What if I give you three guesses? No?

  “Absolutely. Remember, this is all part of a dream. And what is your dream, Louis, your most cherished dream? To make a success of this writing business, isn’t it? Financial independence so you can win this American lady you’ve come mooning after. Well, in this dream you’re having right now, you’ve met a man from the future—that’s me—and I’ve come back through time to tell you that you’ve got it, baby. All you wanted. Everything. Mrs. Osbourne too.”

  “What nonsense. I’m dying penniless, unknown, and (I fear) unloved.” Stevenson’s eyes grew moist. “I came such a long way to do it, too. She sent me away! What does she care if I expire in this wilderness?”

  “Louis, Louis, work with me, all right?” Joseph leaned forward, looking earnest. “This is your dream. This dream says you’re going to become a famous author. You write slam-bang adventure stories.”

  “I write abominably derivative fiction. The only good stuff’s from life, my essays and the travel books.”

  Oh, gee, no, you haven’t.” Joseph consulted his timepiece. “You’ll just miss it. Never mind— So, in the future, we have these exhibitions of our photo-plays and people pay admission to come in and watch them, the same way they’d watch a live play or an opera, with famous players and everything. But since we don’t have to pay live actors or even move scenery, the profit margin for the exhibitor is enormous. See?”

  Stevenson gaped at him a moment before responding. “I was wrong. I apologize. You may or may not be the Devil, but you’re most assuredly a Yankee.”

  “No, no, I’m a dream. Anyway. People are crazy about these photoplays, they’ll watch anything we shoot. We’ve adapted all the great works of literature already. Shakespeare, Dickens, all those guys. So now, my masters are looking for new material, and since you’re such a famous and successful writer they sent me to ask if you’d be interested in a job.”

  “I see.” Stevenson leaned back, stretching out his long legs and crossing them. “Your masters want to adapt one of my wonderful adventure stories for these photo-plays of theirs?”

  “Uh, actually, we’ve already done everything you wrote. Several times.”

  “I should damned well hope I got royalties, then!”

  “Oh, sure, Louis, sure you did. You’re not only famous, you’re rich. Anyway what my masters had in mind was you coming up with something completely new. Never-before-seen. Just like all your other stuff, you know, with that wonderful Robert Louis Stevenson magic, but different. Exclusively under contract for them.”

  “You mean they want me to write a play?” Stevenson looked intrigued.

  “Not exactly. We don’t have the time. This dream isn’t going to last long enough for you to do that, because it’s a matter of historical record that you’re only going to lie here another—” Joseph consulted his timepiece again, “—forty-three hours before you’re found and nursed back to health. No, see, all they need you to do is develop a story treatment for them. Four or five pages, a plot, characters. You don’t have to do the dialogue; we’ll fill that out as we film. We can claim it’s from long-lost notes found in a locked desk you used to own, or something.”

  “This is madness.” Stevenson sipped his tea experimentally.

  “Delirium. But what have you got to lose? All you have to do is comeup with a concept and develop it. You don’t even have to write it down. I’ll do that for you. And to tell you the honest truth—” Joseph leaned down confidentially, “—this is a specially commissioned work. There’s this wealthy admirer of yours in the place I come from, and he’s willing to pay anything to see a new Robert Louis Stevenson picture.”

  “Wouldn’t he pay more for a whole novel? I could make one up as we go along and dictate the whole thing to you, if we’ve got two more days here. You’d be surprised at how quickly stories unfold when the muse is with me.” Stevenson squinted thoughtfully up at the stars through the branches of the oak tree. Joseph looked slightly embarrassed. “He’s… not really much of a reader, Louis. But he loves our pictures, and he’s rich.”"

He resembled a naked lunatic trying to tunnel out of an asylum. That didn’t matter, though, in light of the fascinating data Lewis was picking up as he scanned Petrie’s brain activity.

  Flinders Petrie stood in the shaft without, just at the edge of the lamplight. He was surveying the wreckage of the wall with leonine fury, and the fact that he was wearing a pink singlet, pink ballet tutu and pink ribboned slippers did nothing to detract from the terror of his anger. Nor did the rifle he was aiming at Lewis’s head.

  “Come out of there, you little bastard,” he said. “Look at the mess you’ve made!”

  “I’m sorry!” said Lewis.

What’s a super-cyborg? What the hell are you, eh?” Lewis raced mentally through possible believable answers, and decided on:

  “I’m afraid you’re right. I’m a thief; I was paid a lot of money by a certain French count to bring back antiquities for his collection. The Comte de la, er, Cyborg. He ordered me to infiltrate your expedition, because everyone knows you’re the best—”

  “Ballocks,” said Petrie. “I mean what are you?” Lewis blinked at him. “What?” he repeated.

  “What kind of thing are you? You’re no human creature, that much is obvious,” said Petrie.

  “It is?” In spite of his horror, Lewis was fascinated. He scanned Petrie’s brain activity and found it a roiling wasps’ nest of sparks.

  “It is to me, boy,” said Petrie. “Mosquitoes won’t bite you, for one thing. You speak like an actor on the stage, for another. You move like a machine, mathematically exact. I’ve timed the things you do.”

  “What kinds of things?” Lewis asked, delighted.

  “Blinking once every thirty seconds precisely, for example,” said Flinders Petrie. “Except in moments when you’re pretending to be surprised, as you were just now. But there’s not much that surprises you, is there? You knew about this shaft, you very nearly dragged Ali to this spot and showed him where to dig. It was so we’d do all the work for you, wasn’t it? And then you’d make off with whatever was inside.”

  “Well, I’m afraid I—”

  “You’re not afraid. Your pupils aren’t dilating as a man’s would,” said Petrie relentlessly. “You haven’t changed color, and you’re breathing in perfect mechanical rhythm.” But his own hand shook slightly as he pulled back the hammer on the rifle. “You’re some kind of brilliantly complicated automaton, though I’m damned if I can think who made you.”

  “That’s an insane idea, you know,” said Lewis, gauging how much space there was between Petrie and the side of the shaft. “People will think you’re mad as a hatter if you tell anyone.” Petrie actually chuckled. “Do I look like a man who cares if people think I’m mad?” he said. He cut a bizarre little jete, pink slippers flashing. “It’s bloody useful, in fact, to be taken for a lunatic. Why d’you think I keep this ensemble in my kit?

So I confiscated the thing.

There was the rising sun streaming in through the blinds, and green papyrus waved on the river bank, and pyramids and crocodiles were all over the place. The ancient Nile! The romance of Egypt!

  Lewis sipped his champagne and selected a scroll from the cache.

“Then I climbed down the hillside to see what comes out at the bottom, after what must be about two years of ripening in its slo-o-ow passage down the hill, pushed by all the muck thrown in above it. Guess what I found down there, oozing into the sunlight?”
“Terra preta!” cried Lewis.
“Bingo,” said Mendoza calmly, reaching for another guava.
“It’s just compost?” said Lewis. “How anticlimactic.”
“No, no. It’s made with compost; but there’s some microbial content I can’t identify. The stuff that makes it work like sourdough starter, I guess.”
“A secret ingredient,” said Lewis.
“That’s right,” said Mendoza. “A completely organic, self-renewing fertilizer so powerful it could convert the Sahara to prime farmland. And these mortals are the only ones left who know how to make it.”
“Oh, dear,” Lewis murmured. He looked at Mendoza with wide eyes. “You do realize, don’t you, that once we make our report, the Company is going to do a lot more than send anthropologists to study these people? It’ll do whatever it takes to get the secret out of them"

He heard the commotion before the scream came; incandescent wrath scorching through the ether, hissed interrogation, the child’s stammering replies. Then the scream followed, but by that time he was already down from his ladder and running.
They were on the terrace with the fish ponds. Tanama was clutching a golden basket half full of watercress, but the cress was spilling out because Mendoza had caught her by one wrist. The child was sobbing.
“I have to!” she protested. “It’s his sacred food!”
“Mendoza!” Lewis grabbed her arm. “You’re hurting her!”
“They’re infecting that boy on purpose,” said Mendoza. She was shaking with anger. “They know exactly what they’re doing. And they could cure him if they wanted to! Look!” She let go Tanama’s wrist, but pointed an accusatory finger at the plantings on either side of the walkway.
“Baccharis Trimera,” she said, spitting out the botanical name like a curse. “Pemus Boldus. Boerhavia Caribaea. All of them specifics for liver trouble, all of them vermifuges. But what are they giving him? This stuff!” She seized up a frond of watercress and held it out to Lewis.
Dazed, Lewis took the cress. Yes; the leaves were full of cysts that would develop into liver fluke, if ingested. More significant just now, however, was the fact that Orocobix was coming down the steps, followed by Atabey and Cajaya.
“What did you do, you little fool?” Cajaya shouted.
Tanama threw herself down before Orocobix, hiding her face.
“I didn’t,” she wept. “The dead lady—she saw—”
Orocobix lifted her gently to her feet, and she clung to him. He looked at Lewis.
“Oh, dear,” he said.
“I’m afraid you have not told us everything,” said Lewis, with all possible diplomacy.
“And why should we?” cried Atabey. “You’re nothing but a servant—” Orocobix lifted his hand and she fell silent.
“It’s the terra preta, isn’t it?” Mendoza demanded, speaking in Cinema Standard. “The microbe’s only produced by infecting someone with liver fluke! They’re sacrificing him, and by inches—for goddamned compost—”
“Mendoza, wait,” said Lewis. Orocobix was watching their faces closely.
“I trust you’ll pardon us our omission,” he said. “It’s a state secret, you see. But I suppose you must be told…”

He’s not less able to resist the parasites—he’d have died by now. He fights them off! That’s why the damn mortals keep reinfecting him! And his body fights them off by producing the bacteria—
Which also produce the terra preta. Lewis almost heard the click as the puzzle pieces snapped into place. He stared at Orocobix. He must have been tested in childhood—so must Agueybana—and found wanting. Their bodies did not generate the magic microbes. They’d been cured and allowed to live normal lives. The women were never tested, but carried the recessive.
For a moment Lewis saw so clearly the immensity of what had been here, once: the great agricultural empire expanding, the black islands rising from the plain of thin poor soil, the unfruitful rain forest conquered and made to bear. The royal family, presiding over the people they had subjugated with promise of eternal plenty. Their thousands of subjects lived in peace in hilltop gardens, never knowing hunger, with death merely the promise of a more carefree life.
But, at the heart of this earthly paradise…always somewhere a young man suffering in darkness, voiding gold from his bowels and bladder.
The royal family had understood exactly the genetic reasons for their wealth, and the mechanism of infestation.
Here on this island they had issued commands, received tribute, and calculated their bloodlines to a nicety. Here they had huddled together, immune, when the unknown epidemic came, and their subjects died to the last man, woman and child. The stench of the far gardens must have risen up to heaven. Here they had dwindled over the decades, as the extended family died back. Here they had married cousins and finally brothers and sisters, and in a few more years would have come to nothing anyway.
And no poet to sing their story! Lewis cried from his heart.
The bastards, Mendoza transmitted bitterly. The mortal bastards. Send them a miracle and they’ll never fail to nail it to a cross.
All this in a split second, and Orocobix was still looking at Lewis, hoping his proposition had found favor. Lewis drew breath and bowed, knowing what he must say.
“I think my master will be pleased, Great Orocobix,” he said, blandly.

“Don’t think about it,” said Lewis. “Just don’t. Think about anything else. Fairies dancing in the moonlight. The meaning of Rosebud. The far-off tinkle of little golden temple bells.”
“Or, for example, my disciplinary hearing,” said Mendoza.
“What disciplinary hearing?”
“The one I’ll get when the anthropologists discover what I did. I sneaked into the damn Room of Sacrifice again last night. Gave that boy a dose of medication to kill liver flukes,” said Mendoza, starting up the hill again. Lewis stared after her a moment, then ran to catch up.
“Bravo,” he said. “Bravo! But it won’t make any difference, I’m afraid. He’ll only be reinfected.”
“No, he won’t.” Mendoza reached the top and swung around to face Lewis. “Because after I dosed the kid, I went out to the fish ponds. Yanked out every last little bit of watercress. And smashed every damn snail I could find.”
Her eyes were sullen, her mouth was hard, and Lewis thought he had never loved her more than in that moment.
“I had to, Lewis. That temple room was the most obscene thing I’d seen since…since England.” England, where a young man had gone willingly to the stake because he believed it was his duty.
“I know,” said Lewis gently, seeing the tall specter loom beside her, and knowing it would never go away. Nicholas Harpole’s shadow rose with her in the morning, walked with her in all her ways, and lay down beside her at night.
“It still won’t make any difference,” she went on. “You can bet Dr. Zeus will infect him again, once the Company gets its hands on him. They’ll want to experiment on him, won’t they?”
“It won’t be that bad,” Lewis said. “The Company isn’t inhumane. They’ll cure him again once they get their answer, and then—well, the Guanikina will learn they’re not gods, and will that really be such a bad thing? Better than living in ever-increasing squalor and—and—”
“And incest,” said Mendoza. “You’re right, of course.”
“And who cares what the anthropologists think anyway? We’ve still made an amazing discovery. How often do lowly field operatives discover something about which All-Seeing Zeus didn’t already know?” said Lewis, more cheerfully.

June 30, 1958, family of five killed. ’46 Plymouth Club Coupe. Driver lost control of the car and went off the edge of the road. Car rolled seventy meters down that hill and hit the rocks, right there. Gas tank blew. Mr. and Mrs. William T. Ross of Visalia, California, identified from dental records. Kids didn’t have any dental records. No relatives to identify bodies.
“Articles in the local and Visalia papers, grave with the whole family’s names and dates on one marker in a cemetery in Visalia. Some blackening on the rocks up there. That’s all there is to show it ever happened.”
“Okay,” say the younger man, nodding thoughtfully. “No witnesses, right?”
“That’s right.”
“The accident happened on a lonely road, and state troopers or whoever found the wreck after the fact?”
“Yeah.”
“And the bodies were so badly burned they all went in one grave?” Clete looks pleased with himself. “So…forensic medicine being what it was in 1958, maybe there weren’t five bodies in the car after all? Maybe one of the kids was thrown clear on the way down the hill? And if there was somebody in the future going through historical records, looking for incidents where children vanished without a trace, this might draw their attention, right?”
“It might,” agrees Porfirio.
“So the Company sent an operative to see if any survivors could be salvaged,” says Clete. “Okay, that’s standard Company procedure. The Company took one of the kids alive, and he became an operative. So why are we here?”
Porfirio sighs, watching the barn.

“He was emotionally unstable,” Porfirio admits. “Nobody was surprised by that, after what he’d been through. But he didn’t kill Professor Riverdale. He did run away, though. Walked, actually. He walked through a solid wall, in front of the professor and about fifteen other people in the audience. He’d been giving them a lecture in advanced temporal paradox theory. Just smiled at them suddenly, put down his chalk, and stepped right through the blackboard. He wasn’t on the other side when they ran into the next room to see.”
“Damn,” says Clete, impressed. “We can’t do that.”
“We sure can’t,” says Porfirio. He stiffens, suddenly, seeing something move on the wall of the barn. It’s only the shadow of the circling hawk, though, and he relaxes.

The mortals running the 1964 operation had hunted him with predictable lack of success. After the ripples from that particular causal wave had subsided, the mortal masters up in the twenty-fourth century set their immortal agents on the problem.
The ones who were security technicals, that is. The rank-and-file Preservers and Facilitators weren’t supposed to know that there had ever been mistakes like Robert Ross. This made searching for him that much harder, but secrecy has its price.

It was assumed that Robert, being a genius in Temporal Physics, had somehow managed to escape into time. Limitless as time was, Robert might still be found within it. The operatives in charge of the case reasoned that a needle dropped into a haystack must gravitate toward any magnets concealed in the straw. Were there any magnets that might attract Robert Ross?
“Baseball!” croaked Professor Riverdale, when Security Executive Tvashtar had gone to the nursing home to interview him. “Bobby just loved baseball. You mark my words, he’ll be at some baseball game somewhere. If he’s in remission, he’ll even be on some little town team.”
With trembling hands he drew a baseball from the pocket of his dressing gown and held it up, cupping it in both hands as though he presented Tvashtar with a crystal wherein the future was revealed.
“He and I used to play catch with this. You might say it’s the egg out of which all our hopes and dreams hatch. Peanuts and Crackerjack! The crack of the bat! The boys of summer. Bobby was the boy of summer. Sweet Bobby…He’d have given anything to have played the game…It’s a symbol, young man, of everything that’s fine and good and American.”
Tvashtar nodded courteously, wondering why mortals in this era assumed the Company was run by Americans, and why they took it for granted that a stick-and-ball game had deep mystical significance. But he thanked Professor Riverdale, and left the 1970s gratefully. Then he organized a sweep through time, centering on baseball.
 
“And it didn’t pan out,” says Clete. “Obviously.”
“It didn’t pan out,” Porfirio agrees. “The biggest search operation the Company ever staged, up to that point. You know how much work was involved?”
 
It had been a lot of work. The operatives had to check out every obscure minor-league player who ever lived, to say nothing of investigating every batboy and ballpark janitor and even bums who slept under the bleachers, from 1845 to 1965. Nor was it safe to assume Robert might not be lurking beyond the fruited plains and amber waves of grain; there were Mexican, Cuban and Japanese leagues to be investigated. Porfirio, based at that time in California, had spent the Great Depression sweeping up peanut shells from Stockton to San Diego, but neither he nor anyone else ever caught a glimpse of Robert Ross.
It was reluctantly concluded that Professor Riverdale hadn’t had a clue about what was going on in Robert’s head. But, since Robert had never shown up again anywhere, the investigation was quietly dropped.
Robert Ross might never have existed, or indeed died with his mortal family. The only traces left of him were in the refinements made to the immortality process after his disappearance, and in the new rules made concerning recruitment of young operatives.
The Company never acknowledged that it had made any defectives."

“And a gnomon is the piece on a sundial that throws the shadow,” says Clete promptly. He grins. “Sundials. Time. Temporal physics. They just can’t resist leaving clues, can they?”
Porfirio shakes his head. Clete finishes the potato chips, tilting the can to get the last bits.
“So when the guy was programmed with a Happy Place, it wasn’t baseball he fixated on,” he speculates. “It was 1951. ‘The Golden Year.’ He had a compulsion to be there in 1951, maybe?”

“Wow! That is so much old stuff!” Calvin winked knowingly at the kameramen. He sang a snatch of that week’s popular tune: “Can’t get it into my pooor little heaaad! Pretty but dumb, folks, what can I tell you? Here’s another look at the paintings on auction today!”
The kameramen relaxed, turning away as the prerecorded montage of paintings ran. Calvin Sharpey dropped his flashy smile and shouted for a glass of water, ignoring Van Drouten, who remained on her mark. She merely adjusted the drape of the gray gown that had been cut to make her look as dull as possible, a nonentity the audience would forget thirty seconds after her interview had ended, especially when contrasted with Calvin Sharpey’s rhinestones.
Now the montage was ending, to judge from the way the kameramen stiffened and swung their blank avid faces back to center stage. Immediately on again, Calvin Sharpey grabbed the pasteboard sheet his PA handed him. He held it up—it was a color print of the Girl with Pearl Earring, with the face cut away to an oval hole—and thrust his face through, mugging as the kameramen focused on him again.
“Welcome baa—aack!” he said. “It’s Calvin Sharpey! Weren’t those paintings really something?”
In a high, dark, and distant room, someone stopped pacing and regarded the floating image of Calvin Sharpey’s magnified smirk.
“Fire that dumb son of a bitch,” said a cold soft voice.
“Right away, Mr. Hearst,” said somebody else, running to a communications console, and, five minutes later on the other side of the globe, Van Drouten watched with interest as Calvin Sharpey was hustled off between two men in gray suits, protesting loudly, but the kameramen had done with him, and with her, too; they were turning away, closing like glassy-eyed wolves to See the media event of the year: the auction of the lost Vermeers."

I’d been followed for three blocks by a Sydney ex-convict whose intent was robbery and possible murder; but I managed to ditch him by ducking into a saloon, exiting out the back and across the deck of the landlocked Niantic, and cutting through another saloon where I paused just long enough to order an oyster loaf and a pail of steam beer"

“What’re those?” Mendoza inquired with her mouth full.
“Samples of gold-bearing quartz,” I explained. “From six different places. I wrote the name of each place on the package in pencil, see? And your job is to test each sample. You’re going to look for a blue-green lichen growing in the crevices with the gold.”
She swallowed and shook her head, blank-faced.
“You need a microbiologist for this kind of job, Joseph, surely. Plants that primitive aren’t my strong suit.”
“The closest microbiologist was in Seattle,” I explained. “And Agrippanilla’s a pain to work with. Besides, you can handle this! Remember the Black Elysium grape? The mutant saccharomyces or whatever it was? You won yourself a field commendation on that one. This’ll be easy!”
Mendoza looked pleased, but did her best to conceal it. “I’ll bet your mission budget just wouldn’t stretch to shipping qualified personnel down here, eh? That’s the Company. Okay; I’ll get started right after dinner.”

“Oh—er—thank you. It’s fun being Rudolph Valentino for a few hours, all the same,” said Lewis, and from out of nowhere he produced a fountain pen. “I don’t suppose I might have your autograph, Mr. Valentino?”
“Certainly,” said Valentino, looking vainly around for something to autograph. From another nowhere Lewis produced a copy of the shooting script, and Valentino took it. “Your name is spelled?”
“L-e-w-i-s, Mr. Valentino. Right there?” he suggested. “Right under where it says The Son of the Sheik?” He watched with a peculiarly stifled glee as Valentino signed: For my “other self” Lewis. Rudolph Valentino.
“There,” said Valentino, handing him the script. “No more falls on the head, yes?”
“Thank you so much. It’s very kind of you to be worried, but it’s all right, you know,” Lewis replied. “I can take a few tumbles. I’m a professional stunt man, after all.”
He tucked the script away in his costume and staggered down to the water’s edge, where the extras and crew were piling into an old stakebed truck. The driver was already cranking up the motor, anxious to begin his drive back to Pismo Beach before the tide turned and they got bogged down again.
Valentino watched Lewis go, shaking his head.
“Don’t worry about that guy, Rudy,” the director told him, knocking sand out of his megaphone. “I know he looks like a pushover, but he never gets hurt, and I mean never.”

“But luck runs out, like sand.” Valentino smiled wryly and waved at the dunes stretching away behind them, where the late slanting sunlight cast his shadow to the edge of the earth. “Doesn’t it? And that one, I think he has the look of a man who will die young.”
Which was a pretty ironic thing for Valentino to say, considering that he’d be dead himself within the year and that Lewis happened to be, on that particular day in 1926, just short of his eighteen hundred and twenty-third birthday.

Hearst peered into the viewscreen in astonishment. He leaned close as the little stories sped by, the attractive people chattering brightly: new mining colonies on Luna, Ulster Revenge League terrorists bombing London again, new international agreement signed to tighten prohibitions on Recombinant DNA research, protesters in Mexico picketing Japanese-owned auto plants—
“Wait,” Hearst said, lifting his big hand. “How do you stop this thing? Can you slow it down?”
I made it pause. The image of Mexican union workers torching a sushi bar froze. Hearst remained staring at the screen.
“Is that,” he said, “what journalism is like, in the future?”
“Well, yes, sir. No newspapers anymore, you see; it’ll all be online by then. Sort of a print-and-movie broadcast,” I explained, though I was aware the revelation would probably give the poor old guy future shock. This had been his field of expertise, after all.
“But, I mean—” Hearst tore his gaze away and looked at me probingly. “This is only snippets of stuff. There’s no real coverage; maybe three sentences to a story and one picture. It hasn’t got half the substance of a news-reel!”
Not a word of surprise about colonies on the Moon.
“No, it’ll be pretty lightweight,” I admitted. “But, you see, Mr. Hearst, that’ll be what the average person wants out of news by the twenty-second century. Something brief and easy to grasp. Most people will be too busy—and too uninterested—to follow stories in depth.”
“Play it over again, please,” Hearst ordered, and I restarted it for him. He watched intently. I felt a twinge of pity. What could he possibly make of the sound bites, the chaotic juxtaposition of images, the rapid, bouncing, and relentless pace? He watched, with the same frown, to about the same spot; then gestured for me to stop it again. I obeyed.
“Exactly,” he said. “Exactly. News for the fellow in the street! Even an illiterate stevedore could get this stuff. It’s like a kindergarten primer.” He looked at me sidelong. “And it occurs to me, Mr. Denham, that it must be fairly easy to sway public opinion with this kind of pap. A picture’s worth a thousand words, isn’t it? I always thought so. This is mostly pictures. If you fed the public the right little fragments of story, you could manipulate their impressions of what’s going on. Couldn’t you?”
I gaped at him.

“Uh—you could, but of course that wouldn’t be a very ethical thing to do,” I found myself saying.
“No, if you were doing it for unethical reasons,” Hearst agreed. “If you were on the side of the angels, though, I can’t see how it would be wrong to pull out every trick of rhetoric available to fight for your cause! Let’s see the rest of this. You’re looking at these control buttons, aren’t you? What are these things, these hieroglyphics?”

“History, or recorded history, Mr. Denham?” Hearst countered. “They’re not at all necessarily the same thing, I can tell you from personal experience.”
“I’ll bet you can,” I answered, wiping away sweat again. “O.K., you’ve figured something out: there are all kinds of little zones of error in recorded history. My Company makes use of those errors. If history can’t be changed, it can be worked around. See?”
“Perfectly,” Hearst replied. He leaned back in his chair and his voice was hard, those violets of sound transmuted to porphyry marble. “I’m convinced your people are on the level, Mr. Denham. Now. You go and tell them that twenty years is pretty much chickenfeed as far as I’m concerned. It won’t do, not by a long way. I want nothing less than the same immortality you’ve got, you see? Permanent life. I always thought I could put it to good use and, now that you’ve shown me the future, I can see my work’s cut out for me. I also want shares in your Company’s stock. I want to be a player in this game.”
“But—” I sat bolt upright in my chair. “Mr. Hearst! I can manage the shares of stock. But the immortality’s impossible! You don’t understand how it works. The immortality process can’t be done on old men. We have to start with young mortals. I was only a little kid when I was recruited for the Company. Don’t you see? Your body’s too old and damaged to be kept running indefinitely.”
“Who said I wanted immortality in this body?” said Hearst. “Why would I want to drive around forever in a rusted old Model T when I could have one of those shiny new modern cars? Your masters seem to be capable of darned near anything. I’m betting that there’s a way to bring me back in a new body, and if there isn’t a way now, I’ll bet they can come up with one if they try.

It was true that a great deal of it consisted of erotica, inclining to the eclectic rather than the perverse. Lewis found a splendid copy of the earliest translation into English of the Kama Sutra. And the library certainly needed putting into order: Gulliver’s Travels jostled for shelf space with books on the Kabbalah, or on architecture, or Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, or Ovid’s Amores. There were indeed a couple of fairly ancient scrolls and codices: a second-century copy of Euripides’ The Bacchae, and a copy of Aristophanes’ The Frogs that was nearly as old.
There were a few fakes, too, most notably a work on alchemy purporting to have been written by Aristotle; these were well done, clearly by a someone who had had access to a cache of very old papyrus and knew a few tricks for compounding period-formula inks. Lewis recognized the hand of a certain forger active in the last century, who had worked from the Eugenikos manuscripts.

Now, however, as new evidence comes to light, it is becoming more and more probable that he was not – that he did only edit, not fabricate, the last forty chapters. Moreover, although the last forty chapters are not by Cao Xueqin himself, it is beginning to look more and more as though they were written by someone very close to Xueqin, probably a member of his family – someone who was familiar with his drafts and wanted a different ending but did not necessarily have any intention of passing off the new ending as the author’s own work."

It came to be used specifically of the dwellings of rich men’s daughters, or, by extension, of the daughters themselves. It follows from this that the fourth and fifth titles (‘A Dream of Red Mansions’ and ‘Twelve Young Ladies of Jinling’) represent somewhat different formulations of the same idea, just as the first and second titles (‘The Story of the Stone’ and ‘The Passionate Monk’s Tale’) both refer to the fiction that the text of the novel started off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting holy man and taken down into the world for publication."

Despite her earlier self-consciousness, Violet settled into her seat, the non-stop chatter and hum of the perpetually busy coffee shop settling into a pleasant white noise as she sipped her drink and listened to the girl. Her name was Geillis, and her pedestrian life as a university student had ended the night she was turned outside of a London concert hall in 1982. Violet had never met a vampire before, hadn’t considered that vampires might be out and about in the middle of the day or drinking tea, had certainly never dreamt that she’d be shanghaied by one, but as she savored the velvety smoothness of her drink—the rich, malty coffee sweetened with a thick cutting of golden honeycomb and turned rich with cream—listening to to girl’s heavily accented patter, she was incredibly grateful that she had been.

He donated the piece and several others to an auction, a fundraiser gala for the Werewolf Defense League, the organization Grayson now worked for. It had been a moment of hubris and pride, quickly extinguished the next time he came home, several months later to surprise his mother for Christmas. Two of the pieces he had donated had been hanging in Grayson’s home, an indication to him that they’d either not sold or had been bid on for so little that his brother had felt sorry for him.
“Because it was what was left at the end of the auction, with the other raffle baskets no one wanted?” He asked tonelessly, not really wanting to hear the answer.

I have this piece, because your brother outbid me and everyone else on the other two. At first, I thought he was just driving up the price. I was a little annoyed, because he knew I wanted them. Then I realized he was bidding to win. He wound up being outbid on the piece from the orphanage, one of the foundation executives got that one, I believe, and he was so mad, I thought he was going to flip his table. I used his distraction to get this one. And I think he was shitty with me about that too.”

“I didn’t raise fools, Lowell. I didn’t raise any of you to be less than your worth. Everyone misses you, and everyone wishes you lived a little closer to home, and it would be nice if you picked up the phone for someone other than Grayson once in a while, but you’re very, very good at what you do, and we're all so proud of you. You are living completely on your own, on the other side of the world from your family, in, according to Gray, occasionally terrible, dangerous circumstances and situations. The last explorer I can think of off the top of my head was Balthazar Hemming, he was the third younger brother of Jackson the . . . third or fourth, I can’t think of which. His brother Grayson is the one who died in the fire. The blue apatite monument in Hostun Park is his, the inscription is on the back side, on a bronze plaque, facing southeast.”
Lowell blinked. Hostun Park was the one behind the cafe, where he’d sat with Moriah, that first afternoon.
“So, who knows, Lowell. You may get your monument and plaque after all. On the day you decide you want to come home, there will be a place for you. No one is pushing you out, no one forgets you exist, or all the other nonsense you moan on and on about. Your brothers have lives, just like you do, and you’re all completely self-absorbed.”
“I can’t imagine where we got that from.”
His father smiled, spreading his hands in an expansive gesture. 
“At least you come by it honestly. That does not mean I’m willing to let you come home to live, because I would sooner burn down the house with myself in it. This is one instance when I don’t care what your mother wants. You’re a monster, and if this human girl, whoever she is, can put up with your insatiable need to be the center of attention and moping and resulting tantrums, I wouldn’t be so quick to let her get away.

            In front of everyone.
         
         
         For a short moment, she felt what it was like to be Yegor. She knew how prickly were his unshaven cheeks. How frozen were
            his feet in their thin shoes. How loudly his heart was beating—just when he was trying to appear indifferent. How insulted
            he felt, how he suffered . . . But why?
         
         
         And right then, still being Yegor, having made Yegor a part of herself, she realized how deeply offended he was. Someone had
            told him about Sterkh’s stipulation. He was made to believe that Sasha started seeing him because of purely physiological
            reasons—Sterkh had told her to get rid of her virginity, and she had . . .
         
         
         Sasha perceived this insult as her own.
         
         “But how could you ever believe this? You are such an idiot!”
         
         She took the bench (cold, apathetic) and the linden tree (sleepy, unmoving blood), and the ground covered with dirty snow

            meticulous study technique, but its value was undeniable. Unlike Portnov’s exercises and Sterkh’s trials, no restrictions
            were imposed on the paragraphs: Sasha was allowed to read the entire textbook if she wanted to, which is exactly what she

         Portnov wore jeans and sweaters. He had blond hair that was beginning to go gray, glasses with narrow lenses, and cold blue
            eyes. He was not a particularly pleasant person, he could be quite rude; Sasha never thought of him as a man, never wondered
            whether he had a family, a wife, a mistress, any children. Portnov was a teacher, a whip-cracker, an animal tamer. Portnov
            was Portnov.
         
         
         But now, it was clear that whoever was sitting in front of Sasha was not human. Moreover, it had never been human. For the first time in her life Sasha saw—recognized, understood—what exactly an “embodied function” was.
         
         
         “What happened, Samokhina?”
         
         Sasha stared at him, forgetting to breathe, completely in awe. A glossary? An activator? A textbook? A textbook that was given
            a human name?
         
         
         “Oleg Borisovich . . . ,” Sasha whispered.

         “What?”
         
         “You . . .”

            you’ve only just seen me?”
         
         
         Sasha managed a shallow nod, and then shut her eyes, trying to drive the tears back into her eyes.
         
         “What’s the matter?” Portnov actually sounded worried. “Sasha?”
         
         “You are not human,” Sasha whispered.
         
         “So? Neither are you.”

         “I remember it.”
         
         “Trust me, I can remember anything you want. I remember being a child. Being raised by monkeys. Being a girl. Working as a
            cabin boy. Saving a baby out of the fire, scoring the winning goal during the World Cup. Memories are projections of events,
            and in this case it is much less important whether the events are real or not.”

         She located a handkerchief in her bag and began to dry her eyes with so much effort, as if she were trying to rub them entirely
            off her face. Portnov watched her with surprise and sympathy.

            of two concepts: two poles, two energy flows, intertwined under the direction of one will. Perhaps the wings were a nod toward

            be prepared for the challenge at the defining moment. On January thirteenth, at noon sharp, both groups, A and B, will enter
            the large assembly hall and take their seats. You will be introduced to the examination committee. You will not be nervous,
            will not feel anxious, you will not have anything with you—under no circumstances are you to have any paper or pens. Nothing!
            The head of the committee will read out the names, and those called will go up to the stage, choose an examination sheet,
            and sign for it in the ledger. You will have three assignments: the first two are standard; the third one is individual, selected
            for each one of you according to your future specialization. In the process of completing this assignment you will cease being
            a human being and commence as Word; for the first time you will reverberate, my dears, and this is quite fundamental.”
         
         
         Sterkh surveyed the audience as if searching for expressions of rapture on the faces turned toward him. No one was smiling:
            everyone looked at him intently and attentively, fans watching a penalty kick going toward the favorite team’s goal.
         
         
         “You should not pay any attention to the drastic changes in your condition, time, space, and internal state. This is going

            to several hours. Don’t worry if things happen fast. Don’t be afraid if the examination seems too long. Remember: the goal

         Wind beat into the glass. Snowflakes rustled. It was getting dark pretty fast; Sterkh clicked the switch. The overhead light
            exposed a small dusty auditorium and nineteen third years silently watching their professor.

            continue saying words, having no idea about their true meaning.”

         It was easier said than done.
         
         On January eleventh, second years were taking their Introduction to Applied Science exam. In the morning, around half past
            seven, Sasha looked out the window and saw Yegor sitting on her porch, between the stone lions.
         
         
         He was just as still and white as the sculptures. Two white piles of snow lay on his shoulders.
         
         “What’s wrong?” Sasha opened the door; the drifting snow licked her fur-lined slippers. “What are you doing here? Did they
            kick you out of the dorm?”
         
         
         “I was reading the Module,” Yegor rose awkwardly from the steps. “Has it ever happened to you . . . Have you ever read your future in the Textual Module?”
         
         
         “Yes,” Sasha said, stepping back inside the entrance hall. “Come in, I’m freezing.”
         
         Yegor stepped in. A yellow lightbulb burned on the landing of the first floor.
         
         “I am going to fail the test,” Yegor said.
         
         “Wait. Did you read it in the Module? But it refers to the most probable future, not the one that’s been established absolutely and irrevocably!”
         
         
         Yegor shook his head. Two small snowballs fell on the floor.
         
         “I’m going to fail. The test is at ten. I won’t pass!”
         
         He stood in front of her, hunched over, small, and pitiful. Sasha analyzed her sensations: she was sorry for Yegor and a little
            uncomfortable on his behalf. As if a child, scared, crying, came to tell her about a boogeyman who lived in the closet.
         
         
         Yes, he used to be her man. She’d worn his sweaters and shirts, she’d walked around with him, never letting go of his hand.
            Only a year ago . . .
         
         
         A year ago, Yegor had come out of the examination room and she’d held him, congratulating him on his success. He’d smelled
            like someone close to her, but his arms had hung lifelessly along his sides, and his response to Sasha’s muddled words had
            simply been, “I’m sorry. I have to get ready for the English exam.”
         
         
         Sasha had survived that day, and many days that came later. And now she looked at Yegor and felt only compassion. And a little
            awkwardness. He was still a human being, and Sasha was not. She knew what they were taught. And he was stumbling around in
            the dark, like a frightened puppy.
         
         
         She held his hands gently.
         
         “Listen. It’s only fear. It’s your materialized fear: get rid of it. You can do it. Farit . . . I mean, Liliya Popova. It
            does not matter what he’s called, but he never asks for the impossible. Concentrate. You will pass the test. In the worst-case scenario you can have up to three makeup
            dates.”
         
         
         Yegor blinked.
         
         “I have a mother, my dad . . . a younger brother. Three makeup dates, you say? Three makeup dates?”
         
         
         He wept.
         
          
         On the way up the stairs she had a brilliant idea. Letting Yegor in and shutting the door, she looked around in search of
            a shiny object.
         
         
         She shook the puff out of a powder compact and wiped the mirror.
         
         “Turn your face to the light.”
         
         And when Yegor silently complied with her request, she sent a flash of light into his eyes.
         
         His pupils did not contract as a normal human being’s, but widened. For a split second a dismal, dwindling, airless world
            opened up to her. Then Yegor squinted.
         
         
         “Don’t close your eyes!”
         
         She tried again, and this time she saw him from the inside: man-word halfway to his actualization, highly complex transformation
            processes, and everything was drowned by sticky gray goo. Fear? Despair? But no matter how hard she tried to see, it was clear
            that she, a third-year student who still hadn’t passed her placement exam, wasn’t going to be able to figure it all out right
            there and then.
         
         
         “Hold on . . . we’ll get through this. We can do it.”
         
         Sasha squeezed his hands, claiming Yegor, making him a part of herself.
         
         
         “Listen to me, only to me. We progress from human being to word, and right now you are at the steepest point of the road.
            When you overcome this obstacle, when you finally realize what you are being taught, you will become absolute. Do you understand?
            You will be eternal. You will become Word and will accomplish your mission. You are a tool of Speech, an instrument of divine
            harmony. You are a participant of creation, and that means you will be. But right now you are a little human being. So you must fight your fear. I will go to your test with you, I will wait . . .
         
         
         “And I will help you.”
         
          
         The second years took a long time to reappear. Sasha waited under the hooves of the bronze horse.
         
         She was a lousy teacher, but she’d “claimed” Yegor more deeply than she’d ever dared to claim another human being. Now she
            knew him better than her own mother. She understood him like no one else; but this morning, when Yegor convulsively embraced
            her and found her lips with his own, Sasha had pulled away.
         
         
         “Not right now,” she’d said in Portnov’s voice. “Focus.”
         
         She’d spurred him on, pushed him and urged him on; like a blood donor, she’d transferred her confidence and her own will to
            win into Yegor. She’d brought him to the exam, nearly leading him by the hand.
         
         
         “There is nothing impossible. There is no reason you cannot pass! Go!”

Christiane de Montcorbier, filleule du docteur Ho et virtuellement élevée par ce grand politicien sung, a été amoureuse de Tcheang, le fils de son parrain.

    À partir de ce moment, le docteur Ho et la jeune Sarène ont voué leur vie à un seul but: lutter contre la drogue par tous les moyens.

Valérie, élevée dans un milieu plus protégé, parmi des gens soucieux de la sensibilité de leur entourage, prend toujours quelque temps à se faire à cette rudesse de soldats.

    Luc, d’autre part, ne se croit pas tenu à cette retenue toute britannique et il engueule Arnaud. Celui-ci est satisfait de cette réaction longuement préparée. Ça lui apprendra, à ce maudit «Anglais», à infliger des corvées de route à un bataillonnaire retraité."

Les gens des Hauts-Plateaux vivent suivant leurs lois, et leurs lois sont impitoyables. Seule la civilisation pourra y substituer des moeurs plus douces, mais pas nécessairement meilleures.

    Valérie compose déjà dans sa tête une lettre pour ses amis les jumeaux Mado et Louis de Montcorbier où elle leur racontera comment la Nihala est devenue propriétaire de douze esclaves et les a libérés sous l’oeil indulgent de son seigneur."

Ses yeux vifs ne perdent pas un détail de la vie fourmillante qui les entoure. Son père lui explique en passant les noms des oiseaux, des arbres et des plantes, exactement comme le faisait Paul lorsqu'il amenait son cadet en expédition.

    Dès le premier bivouac, Ali découvre avec ravissement qu'il est responsable de tout. Il cherche le bois, allume le feu et jette dans le chaudron de fer le riz qu'il a soigneusement mesuré sur les indications paternelles. Grave et attentif, il s'affaire avec diligence.

Le général-duc de Montcorbier était toujours un hôte courtois et attentif. Ses invités ne manquaient de rien et s'illusionnaient en croyant retrouver dans ce pays sauvage le confort des trains sarènes. C'est une illusion que Paul entretenait avec soin.

    Les curieux envoyés de Chambleau, inspecteurs, politiciens et journalistes, devaient trouver ici une entreprise florissante, progressive et rassurante. Les problèmes de régie interne et les disputes de famille entre villages rivaux ne regardaient personne, du moins personne d’outre-mer.

    Les officiers de l'état-major du Nihar, ses ingénieurs et ses régiments entretenaient soigneusement ce mythe. Pour prouver leur intérêt pour ce véhicule moderne et bienvenu, les tribus locales patrouillaient elles-mêmes les abords du chemin de fer. Le général l'assurait, et c'était partiellement vrai.

    Des Voyageurs de la Nuit, parmi les plus convaincants et les plus influents, avaient persuadé quelques Newars des bienfaits de la civilisation bésaranie.

    Ces chefs de clans, plus éclairés que leurs compatriotes, avaient compris surtout que ce lien avec la plaine freinerait les menaces d'invasion et les raids meurtriers des redoutables Gulloks. La faiblesse des villages résidait dans leur isolement. Le voisinage du train, son va-et-vient, l'affluence qu'il apporterait uniraient les Gotalis. Il y avait donc intérêt à protéger ce projet extraordinaire des Bésaranis.

    Les «Apôtres du train», comme se baptisaient eux-mêmes les agents des services secrets, avaient donc formé et entraîné des patrouilles de montagnards. Ceux-ci, toujours avides d'action, surtout contre leurs ennemis héréditaires, secondaient les soldats de l'armée régulière. À cause de leur mobilité, de leur connaissance du pays et surtout de leur férocité, ils étaient beaucoup plus efficaces que les Sarènes dans leur mission protectrice.

He could not, therefore, be blamed if she did so anyway, using as historical precedent a catastrophic incident in which Hermet, Vizier of what had then been only the Kingdom of Thorne, had attempted to revolutionize void travel by circumventing the requirement to tesser-hex through a gate. He had attempted to do so using a particular pharmacological substance which purported to expand consciousness, and thus facilitate his ascent (or descent, depending how one views it) through the many layers of aether. No one had ever found his vessel, the station from which it had launched, or the moon around which the station had orbited; the planetary system itself, absent a gravitational feature, had never quite recovered, necessitating the exodus from—which was a finer way of saying abandonment of—the homeworld.

The Lanscottar Princess had not fared well, accused of treason before her thirtieth birthday and executed, leaving behind heirs to be raised as Tadeshi. Since that time—some two hundred years, give or take—the Lanscottar had sulked and suffered at the margins of the Free Worlds, fiercely independent and, at the same time, marginalized as an archaic curiosity. They had produced, along with a surfeit of animal-derived textiles, the economist-philosopher deCharry, who had spent a full third of his life imprisoned for sedition, and whose treatise on the feudal roots of contemporary customs of employment and remuneration spawned no fewer than six reformation movements, two of which had succeeded. It was deCharry’s fault, if one could use the label, that the Tadeshi King must share governance with a Council of Ministers and that he was accountable to public constituents. It was that very system, in fact, that had enabled Vernor Moss to rise from relative obscurity to Regency in fewer years than deCharry’s imprisonment.

			 There are rumors that the arithmancer was removed from her post and exiled to Lanscot, doomed to spend the remainder of her career studying various subspecies of a particularly tenacious shrub that did not mind the dismal conditions. There are other rumors that place her in the Tadeshi embassy on the mirri homeworld, where the flora was small, round, and extremely toxic; and still a third set of rumors have her fleeing to Kreshti, where she assumed a new identity and achieved a comfortable living growing ferns. The precise details of her fate are less important than the actual fact that, shortly after her experiment with seasonal hexing, she no longer resided on Urse.
			 This fact mattered to several people. Three of those four were her friends and colleagues. The last one was a child—and, as such, still curious, bored, and seeking instability—who spent as much time as possible (excessive amounts, by his father’s reckoning) in the arboretum. The arithmancer had discovered him one afternoon in the stand of ornamental cherry trees, collecting the fallen petals and weeping; he was convinced that the trees, in losing their flowers, must be dying. He was a very small boy, and shy, and rather weedy himself. His affinity for plants seemed rather natural to the arithmancer; and having found an audience interested in the habits of ornamental flowering trees, she waxed loquacious on the subject. She thought, when the boy finally departed, that he would not return.

Soon the boy knew every plant species in the arboretum, and had amassed the sort of obsessive expertise in a subject only possible for children and doctoral candidates.

He could not put her in a dungeon for two reasons. Firstly, a dungeon is impractical on a void-station, not because of its cramped confines and windowless chambers—which are standard, and unremarkable because of that—but because the horror of a dungeon relies on its damp walls and vermin, and the Regent was short of both. Ordinarily he did not consider that much of a loss. Today, he mourned their absence, though not necessarily for Rory herself; he did not like the look of her body-maids, one for her Kreshti complexion, and the other for her size, and both together for the looks of sheer murder they cast about like most men cast shadows. He comforted himself with the knowledge that he did have free cells in the detention block, and while those cells lacked mold or rats, they were designed to render their occupants miserable. They remained an option, should the Princess require incentive for good behavior, though the Regent did not expect that she would. Rory had proven herself resourceful and clever, but still, at the end of it, too pragmatic to offer resistance for its own sake, particularly when the consequences would be borne by others.
			 The second reason for avoiding a dungeon—or a detention cell—as Rory’s residence was this: prisoner-princesses do not fare well in dungeons, not because of any inherent incompatibility, but because, politically, a princess in a dungeon invariably wins the sympathies of the sovereign’s own allies—children, cousins, siblings, and, most damning, the jailors themselves.

God had already wasted a miracle on Janice, and now He was doing it again. It was at that moment that another beam of Heaven’s light penetrated the cloud cover and struck Neil, trapped in his vehicle. Like a thousand hypodermic needles the light punctured his flesh and scraped across his bones. The light unmade his eyes, turning him into not a formerly sighted being, but a being never intended to possess vision. And in doing so the light revealed to Neil all the reasons he should love God. He loved Him with an utterness beyond what humans can experience for one another. To say it was unconditional was inadequate, because even the word “unconditional” required the concept of a condition and such an idea was no longer comprehensible to him: every phenomenon in the universe was nothing less than an explicit reason to love Him. No circumstance could be an obstacle or even an irrelevancy, but only another reason to be grateful, a further inducement to love. Neil thought of the grief that had driven him to suicidal recklessness, and the pain and terror that Sarah had experienced before she died, and still he loved God, not in spite of their suffering, but because of it. He renounced all his previous anger and ambivalence and desire for answers. He was grateful for all the pain he’d endured, contrite for not previously recognizing it as the gift it was, euphoric that he was now being granted this insight into his true purpose. He understood how life was an undeserved bounty, how even the most virtuous were not worthy of the glories of the mortal plane. For him the mystery was solved, because he understood that everything in life is love, even pain, especially pain. So minutes later, when Neil finally bled to death, he was truly worthy of salvation.

His reviews, collected in In Search of Wonder, along with James Blish’s in The Issue at Hand, were major influences on the writers of their time. Damon wasn’t always right, but he was always forceful and his force was toward higher aspirations and greater achievements. For instance, he never understood Van Vogt’s strengths (or if he did he never acknowledged them). But when I was planning a series of academic editions for the Perennial Library, I had the inspiration of asking Damon to do an introduction to The World of Null-A, as a kind of reappraisal, and Damon agreed. But Perennial canceled the series before anything was written."

She was startled the first time she stood up: she was taller than she expected. Balancing at such a height without the use of her arms was unnerving, and simultaneously feeling the texture of the ground through the soles of her feet made it positively bizarre. Rescue workers, finding her wandering down the street dazedly, thought she was in shock until she—marveling at her ability to face them at eye level—explained to them what had happened. When statistics were gathered for the visitation, the restoration of Janice’s legs was recorded as a blessing, and she was humbly grateful for her good fortune. It was at the first of the support group meetings that a feeling of guilt began to creep in. There Janice met two individuals with cancer who’d witnessed Rashiel’s visitation, thought their cure was at hand, and been bitterly disappointed when they realized they’d been passed over. Janice found herself wondering, why had she received a blessing when they had not? Janice’s family and friends considered the restoration of her legs a reward for excelling at the task God had set for her, but for Janice, this interpretation raised another question. Did He intend for her to stop? Surely not; evangelism provided the central direction of her life, and there was no limit to the number of people who needed to hear her message. Her continuing to preach was the best action she could take, both for herself and for others. Her reservations grew during her first speaking engagement after the visitation, before an audience of people recently paralyzed and now wheelchair-bound. Janice delivered her usual words of inspiration, assuring them that they had the strength needed for the challenges ahead; it was during the Q&A that she was asked if the restoration of her legs meant she had passed her test. Janice didn’t know what to say; she could hardly promise them that one day their marks would be erased. In fact, she realized, any implication that she’d been rewarded could be interpreted as criticism of others who remained afflicted, and she didn’t want that. All she could tell them was that she didn’t know why she’d been cured, but it was obvious "

These were people who, when they died, descended to Hell in proud defiance of God. Neil himself had read a pamphlet of the humanist movement; what he most remembered was that it had quoted the fallen angels. Visitations of fallen angels were infrequent, and caused neither good fortune nor bad; they weren’t acting under God’s direction, but just passing through the mortal plane as they went about their unimaginable business. On the occasions they appeared, people would ask them questions: did they know God’s intentions? Why had they rebelled? The fallen angels’ reply was always the same: Decide for yourselves. That is what we did. We advise you to do the same. Those in the humanist movement had decided, and if it weren’t for Sarah, Neil would’ve made the identical choice.

It was Ogion who stopped the earthquake. They saw it, they said it.  “My teacher was with me, and his teacher with him,” Ogion said when they praised him. “I could hold the Gate open because he held the Mountain still.” They praised his modesty and did not listen to him.

After the flood, God promises Noah and all of us that it will never happen again.
 But I was not so easily fooled. This whole thing had started because people had been wicked. “Even if we are very naughty, Grandpa?” I asked. My grandfather had laughed then. “That is what it says here in this story.” He looked thoughtful. “But there are other stories,” he told me. Delighted, I asked him to tell me another one.
 The story he told me is very old and dates from the time of the prophet Isaiah. It is the legend of the Lamed-Vov. In this story, God tells us that He will allow the world to continue as long as at any given time there is a minimum of thirty-six good people in the human race. People who are capable of responding to the suffering that is a part of the human condition. These thirty-six are called the Lamed-Vov. If at any time, there are fewer than thirty-six such people alive, the world will come to an end.
 “Do you know who these people are, Grandpa?” I asked, certain that he would say “Yes.” But he shook his head. “No, Neshume-le,” he told me. “Only God knows who the Lamed-Vovniks are. Even the Lamed-Vovniks themselves do not know for sure the role they have in the continuation of the world, and no one else knows it either. They respond to suffering, not in order to save the world but simply because the suffering of others touches them and matters to them.”
 It turned out that Lamed-Vovniks could be tailors or college professors, millionaires or paupers, powerful leaders or powerless victims. These things were not important. What mattered was only their capacity to feel the collective suffering of the human race and to respond to the suffering around them. “And because no one knows who they are, Neshume-le, anyone you meet might be one of the thirty-six for whom God preserves the world,” my grandfather said. “It is important to treat everyone as if this might be so.”
 I sat and thought about this story for a long time. It was a different story than the story of Noah’s Ark. The rainbow meant that there would be a happily-ever-after, just as in the stories my father read to me at bedtime. But Grandpa’s story made no such promises. God asked something of people in return for the gift of life, and He was asking it still.
 Suddenly, I realized that I had no idea what it was. If so much depended on it, it must be something very hard, something that required a great sacrifice. What if the Lamed-Vovniks could not do it? What then? “How do the Lamed-Vovniks respond to the suffering, Grandpa?” I asked, suddenly anxious. “What do they have to do?” My grandfather smiled at me very tenderly. “Ah, Neshume-le,” he told me. “They do not need to do anything. They respond to all suffering with compassion. Without compassion, the world cannot continue. Our compassion blesses and sustains the world.”

She told me that Rachel had been a very beautiful woman and that my grandfather had been deeply in love with her for all of their marriage. “But he never spoke of her,” I said.
 “No, he didn’t,” my mother replied. “He was a very private man.”
 Her parents had lived their married life according to the laws of Orthodox Judaism. For two weeks of every month, a married couple sleeps together in the same large bed. For two weeks after the beginning of the wife’s menses, she sleeps alone in a small bed at the foot of her marriage bed. At the end of this time of separation, she goes with other women to the Mikvah, the ceremonial baths, to renew herself by bathing in the living waters and saying prayers. That night she will again sleep in her husband’s arms.
 When she returned home from the baths to resume the physical side of her marriage, my grandmother faced a common problem. Orthodox law forbade her husband to look directly at her, and both her religion and Victorian modesty made speaking of sexuality simply out of the question. My mother’s eyes met mine. “So women of her generation found their own ways to tell their husbands they would once again be together,” she said.
 The evening after she returned from the Mikvah, my grandmother Rachel would go to the study where my grandfather was as usual deeply engrossed in the study of the Talmud or the Kabbalah. Without saying a word to him, she would take the spice box from its customary place on the shelf and place it on the library table next to his hand. I could imagine my grandfather as a young man, never lifting his eyes from the holy book and smiling. “When he had finished studying, he would come upstairs to their bedroom bringing the spice box with him,” my mother said tenderly. “We children always knew.”
 Deeply touched, I looked at my mother. “Did it look like a little castle, Mom?” I asked her. She smiled and nodded. I told her that I remembered seeing it on the library table when I was small and asked her what had become of it. She gave me the sort of look that only women exchange. “It’s with your grandfather,” she told me. “He wanted us to bury him with it.”
 My grandmother had died young, long before I was born. She had left the spice box with him for almost twenty-five years. But he had finished studying now and come upstairs. Their separation was over and once again he would sleep in her arms.

“We never needed to do stuff like that,” Wayne said, eyeing the thieves as they leveled guns at the partygoers, silencing them. “Seein’ as to how if we witness a crime, the guys doing it are usually dead by the end.” He shot Waxillium a glare.

His friend was gleefully leaping off a table toward a man with a shotgun. The two became a blur as Wayne activated a speed bubble. In an instant he was in a different place—bullets zipping through the area he’d left—hiding behind an overturned table, the bandit with the shotgun limp on the ground.
Wayne’s favorite tactic was to get close, then catch one person in the speed bubble and fight them alone. He couldn’t move the speed bubble after putting it up, but he could move around inside of it. So when he released the bubble after fighting his chosen foe one-on-one, he’d be standing in a different place than expected. Foes found him incredibly difficult to track and aim at.
But in a long fight, they’d eventually catch on and hold their fire until just after Wayne dropped a bubble. It took a couple of seconds between dropping one and putting up another, the time when Wayne was most vulnerable. Of course, even when the bubble was up, Wayne wasn’t completely safe. It could be nerve-racking to know that his friend was fighting alone, enclosed by a bubble of accelerated time. If Wayne got into trouble while inside, Waxillium couldn’t help. Wayne would be shot and bleeding before the bubble collapsed.
Well, Waxillium had his own troubles. With those aluminum"

He’d only missed once.

Tarson apparently realized that Waxillium wouldn’t fire. So he swung his gun away from Marasi’s head and toward Waxillium.

Thinking over quotes from her professors was another of her nervous habits. She continued to stand on the stone-paved sidewalk, indecisive.

“My means are not so … meaningful as they may seem at first,” she said. “I would be nothing without my uncle’s patronage.”
“Still.”
“Stories,” she said, smiling wistfully. “Stories of the good and the evil. Most people you meet, they aren’t quite either one.”
Waxillium frowned. “I’d disagree. Most people seem basically good.”
“Well, perhaps by one definition. But it seems that either one—good or evil—has to be pursued for it to be significant. People today … it seems they are good, or sometimes evil, mostly by inertia, not by choice. They act as their surroundings prepare them to act.
“It’s like … well, think of a world where everything is lit with the same modest light. All places, outside or inside, lit by a uniform light that cannot be changed. If, in this world of common light, someone suddenly produced a light that was significantly brighter, it would be remarkable. By the same token, if someone managed to create a room that was dim, it would be remarkable. In a way, it doesn’t matter how strong the initial illumination was. The story works regardless.”
“The fact that most people are decent does not make their decency any less valuable to society.”
“Yes, yes,” she said, blushing. “And I’m not saying I wish that everyone were less decent. But … those bright lights and those dim places fascinate me, Lord Waxillium—particularly when they’re dramatically out of order. Why is it that in one instance, a man raised in a basically good family—surrounded by basically good friends, with good employment and satisfactory means—starts strangling women with copper wires and sinking their bodies in the canals?
“And conversely, consider that most men who go to the Roughs adapt to the general climate of lax sensibilities there. But some others—a few remarkable individuals—determine to bring civilization with them. A hundred men, convinced by society that ‘everybody does it this way,’ will go along with the most crude and despicable of acts. But one man says no.”

She blushed. “I … yes. Yes, let’s just say that I’ve heard it. Peret the Black. A rapist and an Allomancer—Pewterarm, I believe. You walked into the lawkeeper station, looked at the board, ripped his picture off and took it with you. Came back three days later with him over the saddle of your horse. Of all the men on the board, you picked the most difficult, most dangerous criminal of the bunch.”
“He was worth the most money.”
Marasi frowned.
“I looked at that board,” Waxillium said, “and I thought to myself, ‘Well, any of these blokes is right likely to kill me. So I might as well pick the one worth the most.’ I needed the money. I hadn’t had anything to eat in three days but jerky and a few beans. And then there was Taraco.”
“One of the great bandits of our era.”
“With him,” Waxillium said, “I figured I could get some new boots. He’d robbed a cobbler just a few days earlier, and I thought if I brought the man in, I might manage to get a new pair of boots out of it.”
“I thought you’d picked him because he’d shot a lawkeeper over in Faradana the week before.”
Waxillium shook his head. “I didn’t hear that until after I brought him in.”
“Oh.” Then, remarkably, she smiled in eagerness. “And Harrisel Hard?”
“A bet with Wayne,” Waxillium said. “You don’t look disappointed.”
“This just makes it more real, Lord Waxillium,” she said. Her eager eyes glittered in an almost predatory way. “I need to write these down.” She fished in her handbag, pulling out a pad and pencil.
“So that’s what motivated you?” Waxillium asked as she scribbled notes. “You study out of a desire to be a hero, like in the stories?”
“No, no,” she said. “I just wanted to learn about them.”
“Are you sure?” he said. “You could become a lawkeeper, go out to the Roughs, live these same stories. Don’t think that you can’t because you’re a woman; high society might lead you to believe that, but it doesn’t matter out beyond the mountains. Out there, you don’t have to wear lacy dresses or smell like flowers. You can belt on some revolvers and make your own rules. Don’t forget, the Ascendant Warrior herself was a woman.”
She leaned forward. “Can I admit something to you, Lord Waxillium?”
“Only if it’s salacious, personal, or embarrassing.”
She smiled. “I like the lacy dresses and smelling like flowers. I like living in the city, where I can demand modern conveniences. Do you realize I can send for Terris food at any hour of the night, and have it delivered?”
“Incredible.” It actually was. He hadn’t realized that was possible.
“As much as I like reading about the Roughs, and though I may like to visit, I don’t think I’d take well to living there. I don’t mix well with dirt, grime, and an overall lack of personal hygiene.” She leaned in. “And, to be perfectly honest, I have no problem at all letting men like you be the ones to belt on revolvers and shoot people. Does that make me a terrible traitor to my sex?”
“I don’t think so. You are pretty good at shooting things, though.”
“Well, shooting things is okay. But people?” She shivered. “I know the Ascendant Warrior is a model for self-actualized women. We have classes on it at the university, for Preservation’s sake, and her legacy is written into the law. But I don’t really want to put on trousers and be her. I feel like a coward for admitting it sometimes.”
“It’s all right,” he said. “You have to be yourself. But none of that explains why you are studying law.”
“Oh, I do want to change the city,” she said, growing eager. “Though I feel that tracking down every criminal and punching holes in them with pieces of metal moving at high speeds is a terribly inefficient way to do it.”

“He is,” Wayne’s voice said from the hallway outside.
Marasi jumped, letting out a faint yelp.
Waxillium sighed. “How long have you been out there?”
Wayne’s head poked around the corner, wearing a constable’s hat. “Oh, a little while. Seemed like you two were having some kind of ‘smart people’ moment. Didn’t want to interfere.”
“Wise of you. Your stupidity can be infectious.”
“Don’t use your fancy words ’round me, son.” Wayne strolled in. Though he wore the constable’s hat, he was otherwise normally dressed in his duster and trousers, dueling canes at his hips.
“Did you succeed?” Waxillium asked, standing up, then reaching down to help Marasi to her feet.

With that, he toppled to the ground.
Marasi gasped, immediately going to his side. Waxillium spun, looking at Tillaume just as the butler turned from his supposed tea preparations and leveled a pistol at Waxillium.
There was no time for thought. Waxillium burned steel—he kept it in him when he thought he might be in danger—and Pushed on the third button of his vest. He always wore one made of steel there, to use either for restoring his metal reserves or as a weapon.
It burst from his vest, streaking across the room and striking Tillaume in the chest just as he pulled the trigger. The shot went wild. Neither the bullet nor the gun registered as metal to Waxillium’s Allomantic senses. Aluminum, then.

“Wrongfully, I assume?”
“Depends on your definition of that particular word and all,” Wayne said. “I shot a man. Innocent one.”
“Was it an accident?”
“Yeah,” Wayne said. “I only meant to rob him.” He paused, looking at the cupboard, seeming distant. He shook his head, then crawled inside, pushing hard and breaking in the back wall.
That wasn’t what she’d expected to hear. She sat back, hands around her legs. “You were a criminal?”
“Not a very capable one,” Wayne said from inside the cupboard. “I’ve always had a problem not taking things. I just grab stuff, you know? And then it’s there, in my fingers. Anyway, I was getting good at it, and I had some friends … they convinced me that I should go a little farther. Really take hold of my destiny, they said. Start going for coin, get into robbing with guns and the like. So I tried it out. Left a man dead. Father of three.”
He pulled out of the broken cupboard, then held something up. It looked like cards of some sort.
“Clues?” she asked eagerly.
“Nudes,” he said, flipping through them. “Old ones. Probably from before our bandits bought this place.” He flipped through a few more, then tossed them back into the hole. “At least it will give the conners something fun to find.” He looked back at her, seeming … haunted, his eyes lying in shadow, face lit on one side by the open window.
“So what happened?” she asked softly. “With you, I mean. Unless you don’t want to tell.”
He shrugged. “I didn’t really know what I was doing, and I panicked. I think maybe I wanted to be caught. Never wanted to shoot that bloke. Just wanted his purse, you know? Old Deadfinger caught me easy. He didn’t even have to beat a confession out of me.” Wayne was quiet for a moment. “I cried the whole time. I was sixteen. Just a kid.”
“Did you know you were an Allomancer?” she asked.
“Sure. That was kinda why I was in the Roughs in the first place, but that’s another story. Anyway, bendalloy is hard to make. Bismuth and cadmium aren’t the kinds of metals you find in your corner store. Didn’t know much about Feruchemy yet, though my father was a Feruchemist, so I had an idea. But storing health, it takes gold.”
He walked over, sitting down on the floor beside her. “Still don’t know why Wax saved me. I shoulda hanged, you know. Killed a good man. He wasn’t even rich. He was a bookkeeper. Did charity work for anyone who needed it—wills drawn up, letters read. Every week, he transcribed letters for the mine workers who couldn’t write, so they could send them home to their families in the city. Found out a lot about him in the trial, you see. Got to see his kids crying. And his wife…”
Wayne reached into his pocket, then unfolded something. A sheet of paper. “Got a letter from them a few months back.”
“They write you letters?” Marasi said.
“Sure. I send them half of what I make. Keeps the kids fed, you know. Figure it makes sense, seein’ as to how I killed their daddy. One went to university.” He hesitated. “They still hate me. Write me the letters to let me know they haven’t forgiven me, that no money will bring back their daddy. They’re right. But they do take the money, so that’s something.”
“Wayne…” Marasi said. “I’m so sorry.”
“Yeah. Me too. Some mistakes, though, you can’t fix by being sorry. Can’t fix them, no matter what you do. Guns and me, we haven’t gotten along ever since. My hand starts shaking when I hold one, wobbling about like a damn fish dumped on the docks. Ain’t that the funniest thing? Like my hand thinks by itself.”

The Church of the Survivor taught that the mists belonged to him, Kelsier, Lord of Mists. He appeared on nights when the mist was thick and gave his blessing to the independent. Whether they be thieves, scholars, anarchists, or a farmer who lived on his own land. Anyone who survived on his own—or who thought for himself—was someone who followed the Survivor, whether he knew it or not.

The second the captain was gone, the heckling began. It wasn’t even original, just more of the same old armored whore catcalls I’d heard since I was a teenager. Now, I knew how to follow orders. I also knew doing this before we’d even left Paradox was a bad idea, but nine years as a fighter had given me some instincts that had nothing to do with fighting.

  Mercs are a lot like animals in some ways. Dominance is very important. Dicks like Cotter were everywhere in the merc world. They got their power by bullying anyone they thought was weaker, pushing at whatever vulnerability they could find. If they locked on to you, the only way to get them off again was to push back so hard they learned to keep their mouths shut. That or kill them, but I didn’t want to make a mess quite so soon into my new job. So, with shove not being an option, I had to make do with push, and the moment the captain called two minutes to launch, I dropped my safety harness and motioned for Cotter to come to the center of the cargo bay.

  “What?” he said, grinning as he clomped over, his giant suit clanging on the scuffed metal floor. “If you want a tumble, sweetheart, you’ll have to wait until we get—”

  I was in the air before he finished. The Lady Gray couldn’t fly, but she could jump so high and fast it didn’t matter. I shot up until I was eye level with the cargo bay lights and then dropped, flipping in midair to land hard with both feet on Cotter’s broad shoulders. I’d angled to land right on the weight balancer that kept his tank of a suit upright, and my impact sent him tilting with a strangled gasp.

  It only knocked him for a moment, but a moment was all I needed. I reached down and popped the hidden safety that’s always in the same place on assembly-line suits, yanking up his face shield with one hand while my other dove to grab his now-bared throat. It was a move that would never have worked on small armor like mine, but then people who wore reasonably sized suits rarely needed this sort of discipline.

  The moment I touched him, Cotter froze. Snapping his neck would be nothing to my armor-powered hand, and he knew it. Very slowly, taking my time, I reached up and plucked the neural net off his shaved head. As was the default in cheap suits like this, his armor went into idle as soon as I broke the connection, trapping him inside.

  Now that he couldn’t throw me off, I shifted my weight and crouched down, lowering my head until I was an inch from his nose. I stopped there a second, letting him take a good, hard look at the reflection of his terrified face in my silver-tinted visor while my fingers slowly tightened on his throat until I was pressing on the last millimeter of space he needed to keep breathing.

  The launch timer ticking just out of sight on my left told me we were running short on time, but I didn’t pick up my pace. Dominance is an animal game. You’ve got to give the animal part of your enemy time to understand they’ve been defeated, otherwise you’ll end up fighting the same fight a dozen times before they get it.

  When I was certain I’d scared him enough, I whispered into my suit’s speakers, nudging the levels slightly to make sure my voice had just the right metallic edge that made people hear your words in their nightmares.

  “Now that I have your undivided attention,” I said slowly, “here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to start this relationship over. This time, you’re going to be a gentleman, or I’m going to make sure you end up a casualty of Caldswell’s infamous bad luck.”

  For a second, it looked like he was going to try and fight. I tightened my grip, cutting off his last fraction of air. “Do you know how to be a gentleman, Cotter?”

  Eyes bulging, Cotter nodded.

  “Show me,” I said, relaxing my hand just enough to let him take a gasp. “What does a gentleman say?”

  “I’m sorry,” he choked.

  I tilted my head. “I’m sorry … what?”

  Cotter was starting to turn a little blue. “I’m sorry, Miss Morris.”

  This was the point where a normal jerk would have told me I’d pay for this insult or something else equally stupid, but Cotter, for all his skullhead flaws, was a merc like me. We both understood that this had been a fight for control, and I’d won. Of course, that didn’t mean he had to like it.

  “You’re a crazy bitch,” he said, stomping back to his harness.

  “Crazy bitch I’m fine with,” I answered. “But hit on me again and I’ll hit you through the bulkhead.”

  He didn’t say anything else, just locked himself down as the thrusters kicked in, pushing us off the planet with a deafening roar.

  I fully expected to have to make my point at least two more times before it stuck, but Cotter didn’t bother me again. He was still a complete ass, bossing people around and bragging endlessly about the time his team saved some minor baron’s life to anyone who would listen, but he never said anything else untoward about me in my hearing. He wasn’t quite as good about not leering when I was out of armor, but he kept his comments to himself, so I let it slide.

With a cry to rival Cotter’s, I swept the thermite blade over my head and into the neck of the closest xith’cal.

  The burning edge sliced clean, cutting scales, flesh, and bone with the same ease. The xith’cal crumpled as the blade slid free, but I didn’t stop to watch it fall.

  My question was answered by gunshots, three of them, echoing from upstairs.

  The final shot had barely sounded before I leaped off the cargo and hit the stairs running, my nearly spent thermite blade hissing in my hand. I exploded into the lounge and skidded to a stop, blade raised, only to see three dead xith’cal lying on the floor with Rupert standing over them, Sasha in his hand.

  For a moment I just stood there, panting and speechless, and then Cotter’s voice crackled in my ear. “That all of them?”

  “Yeah,” I answered, looking at Rupert. “That’s the lot.”

  Caldswell said something over the com that sounded like “Good job,” but I didn’t hear it. All my attention was focused on Rupert as he stepped over the dead aliens and handed me my pistol as calmly as he would hand me a drink. I took it silently, but as my glove made contact with Sasha’s grip, her ammo counter popped up at the bottom left of my vision. Of her thirty-shot clip, she had twenty-seven left.

  Three bullets, three dead xith’cal.

  My eyes went back to Rupert. In my armor, when I’m ready and if the lizards are charging me in a line, I can take three xith’cal with three shots from Sasha. Out of my armor, even relaxed and knowing what to expect, her recoil would have ruined my arm after the first one. Rupert had never shot my pistol before, and he certainly wasn’t in armor, yet there he was, standing in the middle of the lounge with two apparently unbroken arms and three dead xith’cal. My brain was spinning so fast trying to make sense of this that I didn’t understand Rupert the first time he spoke.

  “What?” I said, raising my visor so I could see him without my display cluttering his face.

  He smiled like I’d made a joke. “I said, ‘Does the blade have a name, too?’”

  If I were still in the Blackbirds or the army I’d just report my suspicions up the chain of command and let them deal with it, but Rupert was Caldswell’s man, so I couldn’t very well go to the captain for answers. With my normal route cut off, I was floundering to come up with a suitably clever plan that would uncover what I needed to know without risking the most important job of my career. I still hadn’t thought of anything by the time we reached the hyperspace gate the next morning, and by that point I was entirely sucked into preparations for the jump.

highlight,Fortune's Pawn,Rachel Bach,2024-04-30T04:35:40.061,2024-04-30T04:36:54Z,,"A hyperspace jump is always a grand affair. Everything has to be locked down, because even with the best equipment, the transition can be rough, especially on a smaller ship. It made sense. We were, after all, leaving our own dimension and slipping into the strange space between realities. I didn’t understand much more than that, but neither did anyone who wasn’t a hyperspace engineer. All I knew was that it involved a lot of math, and while any ship with a hyperdrive coil could jump into hyperspace with or without a gate, the gate was the only safe way.

  Free jumps were horribly dangerous, though not because hyperspace itself was dangerous. Hyperspace was actually the safest place you could be, because when a ship went into hyperspace it created its own miniature dimension where it was the only thing that existed. That was why Cotter and I were off duty during jumps: no need for security when there was nothing to attack you. No, what made jumping dangerous was time, or, more specifically, the difference between time in hyperspace and time in the real universe.

  It had been the discovery of the hyperspace coil that had gotten humans off Old Earth. Back then, it wasn’t uncommon for ships to vanish for years, sometimes centuries, though their onboard clocks said they’d only been in hyperspace for a day or two. It was called time dilation, and it was a huge problem. So far as science knew, time only moved forward, but how much and how fast got fuzzy once you left the boundaries of our dimension.

  Getting into hyperspace was simple—all you needed was enough energy of the right kind to jump out of reality, sort of like a fish jumping out of a creek, but the math of landing again at the right place and time was something else entirely. There were millions of variables involved with leaving hyperspace, and an error on any of them could mean coming out decades later than you’d planned to. For centuries this meant only the craziest ships used hyperdrives and everyone else stuck to what they could reach through near light speed travel.

  The gates changed everything. They weren’t even gates, really. “Gate” implies something you go through, but a hyperspace gate is nothing but a space-station-sized supercomputer capable of quickly and accurately doing the computations needed for safe jumps. A gate’s math guaranteed you’d come out of hyperspace exactly where and, more importantly, when you wanted. Jumps across the universe were routine these days. I’d done hundreds of them in my career, but I still prayed to the Sainted King every time to bring me through safely. After all the service I’d given him, I figured it was the least he could do."

  I sat back in surprise. I couldn’t remember anyone ever thanking me for doing my job before. “Thank you for saying so,” I said at last. “I thought you would be mad at me, actually.”

  Nova’s wispy eyebrows shot up. “Why would I be angry?”

  Because all the spacey religious types I’d encountered before had been nut job protesters who thought you shouldn’t shoot other people, even xith’cal. “You just seem to be a peaceful sort of person,” I said instead.

  “Life and death are equal parts of the universal harmony,” she said with a shrug. “Though I am always where I am supposed to be, I don’t exactly want to end up in a xith’cal feed pen.”

  I grinned. That was the most normal thing I’d ever heard her say.

  “We have six and a half hours before we have to return to our duties,” Nova said, getting up off the floor. “What would you like to do?”

  I’d meant to keep working on Rupert’s mystery, but Nova looked so happy about having someone to hang out with, and it wasn’t like I knew what my next step was anyway. “Let’s see,” I said, leaning over to dig into my duffel. “Want to play cards?”

  Nova’s eyes went wide. “I’d love to,” she said. “How do you do it? I’ve never played cards before.”

  That was music to my ears. I love corrupting innocents. “It’s not hard. Here.” I pulled out my deck and, after a quick shuffle, dealt her five off the top. “We’ll start with poker.”

  Nova caught on quick. She couldn’t bluff to save her life, but she counted cards like a pro right from the first hand, no doubt a result of all those years of math you have to master in order to qualify for systems work. I taught her the five basic poker variations and all the common cheats. By the time we got to the royal rules, she was a little cross-eyed.

  “You know a lot about this,” she said after winning our second game. I’d had to cheat a little to be sure she would, but letting people win their first few hands is vital to hooking them in.

  “Survival mechanism,” I said. “When you’re stuck on an asteroid on minimal power for weeks while your superiors decide where they want you, you learn to like cards or you go insane.”

  “How did you manage that?” I asked, picking up my hand.

  “Father didn’t allow it,” she answered, picking up her own. “The Unity of the Cosmos believes gravity clouds clarity. We don’t have it on our stations.”

  I stared at her. “You grew up in zero gravity?” At least that explained why she was so small boned.

  “Not quite zero,” she admitted. “But close enough. And they changed it all the time so we’d never start thinking in terms of down or falling. There is no down or up in the cosmos, only us and the infinite space.”

  “Sounds like an interesting place to grow up,” I said. Actually, it sounded horrible.

  “It was necessary to achieve our attunement to the latent energies,” Nova said seriously, as though this explained everything. “Here, watch.”

  She closed her eyes and started to hum. After thirty seconds, I was getting a little worried, but then the humming stopped, and Nova’s eyes snapped open with a dazed expression.

  “Wow,” she breathed. “That was much harder in hyperspace.”

  I knew I wasn’t going to like the answer, but I asked anyway. “What was?”

  She gave me a funny look and pointed down with the hand that, last I’d seen, had been holding her cards. I followed the gesture, and then my cards went flying as I jumped back. Nova’s poker hand was floating in a perfect fan of cards six inches off our cabin floor.

  “What the hell is that?” I asked, a little sharper than I should have.

  “The latent energies of the cosmos,” she answered, smiling as she tilted her head. In front of her, the cards began to spin slowly in the same direction. “The flow of power at the heart of all life. It can also be called plasmex.”

  I’d heard of plasmex. I’d also heard of gremlins, black magic, and space monsters. Of course, only one of those was making a hand of cards spin in front of me. I stared in wonder for a few more seconds, and then something occurred to me. “Wait,” I said. “So you actually see auras?”

  “Of course I do,” Nova said, her dreamy face collapsing into an expression that almost managed to look insulted. “You didn’t think I would just make something up, did you?”

  “No,” I said quickly. “Of course not.”

Even if I had discovered some huge secret, it wouldn’t have changed anything. I wasn’t leaving this ship unless Caldswell kicked me off, so what did it matter if his cook was something other than he appeared? Rupert hadn’t done anything with it other than keep his head down and try to stay alive. I was the one throwing her weight around and hurting people in the process.

  With a shamed sigh, I opened my eyes. Rupert was still on his knees in front of me, his face turned down as he studied my injured leg. The sight filled me with tenderness, and I leaned down slowly until my forehead bumped against the crown of his head. “I’m sorry,” I said softly.

  Rupert stilled. “For what?”

  I shrugged. “Everything. I got nosy and made a mess when I should have known better. I’m not afraid of you, Rupert. I never have been and I never will be. Whatever you are, it’s none of my business, and I’m going to keep my nose out of it from now on. I just hope you can forgive me for being such a pushy bitch about things.”

  I stared at him, dumbfounded. If I’d been in his shoes through all this, I’d be fuming, but Rupert looked content as a cat in a sunbeam, and eventually, I relaxed as well. If I was honest with myself, I had to admit it was nice to just spend time with him again. Between my initial ill-fated attempts to sleep with him and all the crap that had happened after, I’d almost forgotten how much I enjoyed his company.

  “I guess you’re right,” I said, smiling at him. Then I caught sight of my cards, still sitting where I’d left them, and my smile widened with sudden inspiration. “So Rupert”—I reached over him, grabbing my deck off the dresser—“do you know how to play poker?”

If we’d been playing for money, I’d have been in trouble, but we weren’t, so the only damage I suffered was a bruised ego. It was hard for me to see the cards when he was sitting on the floor, so, after our third game, Rupert joined me on the bed, sitting on the far side with my injured leg stretched over his knees.

  It couldn’t have been a comfortable position. He was too tall to sit up straight under the bunk, so he had to lean sideways, but he didn’t seem to mind. In fact, his posture was more relaxed than I’d ever seen it, and I relaxed as well, letting myself enjoy having Rupert in my bed at last, even if it wasn’t the way I’d planned.

  We talked about stupid, common stuff, mostly how I’d dominated my duchy’s varsity armor league when I’d been in school. He seemed to find the idea of me as a teenage armor jock hilarious. I, however, saw nothing funny about it at all.

  “So why aren’t you in the arena, then?” Rupert said, matching my bid with a pair of the hair clips we were using for chips. “I can’t imagine a recruiter would pass up someone like you.”

  “Who said they did?” I huffed. “I got plenty of offers, but I didn’t want to be a gladiator. They make the girls fight in bikinis, and that’s not the sort of glory I was looking for. Even if I could have gotten a real suit, I wouldn’t have taken a gladiator contract. I’ve never wanted to be anything but a Devastator since I saw the royal squad when I was thirteen, and they don’t recruit out of the arenas.”

  “Because all gladiators, even the good ones, are more about showing off than fighting,” I said authoritatively.

  Rupert laughed. “No, no, I meant why do you want to be a Devastator?”

No matter how many years went by, the memory still made me shiver.

  “I found my calling,” I continued with a shrug. “Looking back, it was kind of obvious. Armor was always the only thing I really liked to do, and the Devastators are the best armor users in the galaxy. One look was enough. From that moment on, I knew exactly what I wanted from my life.”

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I knew it was glossy as black water. It certainly felt slick against my skin, slick and ice-cold, but then, the Mercenary’s Bargain was an icy sort of deal.

  The point of the FWL was to record your final moments so your officers could see how you died, but that wasn’t always how it worked. Sometimes, soldiers died in a way that made their officers look bad, especially in a mercenary company like the Blackbirds whose operations weren’t always on the sunny side of interstellar law. When that happened, FWL footage tended to get “accidentally” erased. That was fine if you were dead, but if you were unlucky enough to actually survive the kind of incident that required the loss of your FWL, then you needed some serious leverage to keep yourself from getting erased as well. That was where the Mercenary’s Bargain came in.

  It went like this: the Mercenary’s Bargain was an aftermarket armor modification that recorded the video track that fed into a suit’s FWL onto a second backup completely separate from the suit’s main computer. Even if the FWL was physically removed, the Bargain would stay in place, preserving the truth of what had actually happened just in case you needed it. This way, even if your FWL footage was destroyed, you always had your own copy.

  The Bargain was a merc’s final line of defense against anyone who wanted to screw us over, and, obviously, it was about as illegal as you could get. Footage recorded by the FWL was considered sacred under Paradoxian law, as good as the king’s own witness. By creating a second Final Word, the Bargain undermined the FWL’s absolute authority, and the king did not tolerate anything that undermined his authority. Admitting you had a Bargain going, even as a private mercenary, was as good as putting your neck in the noose, though I’d always thought I’d count it as worth my life. After all, if things got bad enough that I’d actually have to use my secret footage, I was probably dead anyway, and I saw no point in not taking the bastards down with me.

  Fortunately, things weren’t that bad yet, but thanks to my mercenary’s paranoia I had a resource no one expected. If the static on my records really was from the monster, then the footage recorded by my Bargain would be just as snowy and short as my FWL’s.

  I smiled. Put like that, it wasn’t even a question. It was the same choice I’d made when I’d decided to take Anthony’s tip and apply to Caldswell in the first place. Now as then, there was no doubt what path I’d pick. No one got to be a Devastator by taking the safe road.

  My decision settled like a joint popping back into place, and I immediately felt better. I was back on target, back in the fight, and while curiosity over what I’d seen was still gnawing at my insides, I was more determined than ever that I would not screw this up. The blessed king had dropped a priceless opportunity in my lap, and I absolutely was not going to let it go to waste.

But if Caldswell thought to break me with all this drudge work, he’d picked a sorry target. Like all Paradoxians, I’d spent my first two years out of school at the bottom of the Royal Army, and I’d scrubbed far worse than this.

  When I wasn’t cleaning, I was working. Cotter and I had adjusted our patrol schedule so I got more time on the day cycle. Even so, I was often bored, and while I would never slack on my duty, I wasn’t above doing a little reading while I was walking in circles. I’d loaded Hyrek’s compiled survey into my suit’s memory, and I read it whenever I had the spare time.

  It was slow going. Not that I would ever admit it to the lizard, but the book he’d lent me was hard to read. This was partially because it was in Universal, not my first language, but mostly because it was exactly the kind of dry, overly specific scientific writing you’d expect from an official Terran survey. Also, it was huge. Unlike Paradox, which kept its colonies to a reasonable number, the Terrans had claimed so many planets I don’t think even they could name them all.

  Fortunately, the listings themselves were well organized and fascinating enough to keep me going. The survey was full of strange and sometimes wonderful creatures I’d never heard of. I found a whole list of critters I’d love to see in the wild, but there was nothing remotely like the thing I’d fought in the clearing. There was also no mention of anything like the black alien I’d seen standing behind Ren, among the xith’cal tribes or anywhere else.

  I obeyed, gasping in amazement. The room we were in was even larger than I’d initially thought, and it was filled with a canopy like nothing I’d ever seen. Enormous trees rose from several patches of dirt along the edges of the room, their wide, flat leaves forming an overlapping cover high above our heads. The canopy looked blue green in our floodlights, but most of the leaves’ edges were rimmed with black.

  They’re dying, Hyrek wrote.

  “What did you expect?” Cotter said. “No heat, no light, no water—assuming your plants drink water and not blood.”

  A tribe ship’s heart is its trees. Hyrek’s message came so quickly I could almost hear him slamming his claws against the panel. They grow all through our ships, and their death is the tribe’s death.

  “I’d say they outlived their tribe this time,” I muttered, flicking my light toward a shape on the ground.

  Dead xith’cal lay scattered all across the far side of the large room. They must have died a while ago, because the bodies were pretty well decayed, yet another reason I was happy I hadn’t unsealed my suit. “That’s strange,” I said, turning over the closest body with my foot. “No bullet wounds. They weren’t shot.”

  “They wouldn’t be,” Caldswell said. “Lelgis don’t shoot.”

  There was something in the way he said that that killed my questions before they could form.

  This makes no sense. Lelgis and xith’cal do not fight.

  Hyrek had typed that to Caldswell, but I answered anyway. “I thought xith’cal fought everyone.”

  We fight to eat and for challenge, Hyrek wrote. Lelgis are poison, and they do not fight as we do.

  “Well, something fought them,” I said, sliding my light over the dead bodies, xith’cal and lelgis.

  I’m not a female.

  My face must have been a sight, because Hyrek laughed with a sound like a knife across glass. Xith’cal are born genderless. We live in the hatchery until we come of age, doing both male and female work, and then we pick the gender that suits us best. I didn’t like either, so I didn’t choose.

  “You mean you’re neither?” I said. “What, are you still a child then?”

  Hyrek snorted. Hardly. By human reckoning, I’m almost sixty. Neutrals live as long as females, who live twice as long as males.

  “So you just decided to be genderless?” I said. “You can do that?”

  Obviously, Hyrek typed with a droll look.

  I rolled my eyes and Hyrek sighed. It’s not a common thing. Tribe structure is rigid. Everyone has a place. Females are our thinkers, males are our warriors, females run the ships, males hunt. A genderless adult doesn’t fit into the established order, so you can see how life could be difficult for those who don’t choose.

  I remembered his sleeping arrangements with new appreciation. “That’s why you’re here, then? Because things got ‘difficult’?”

  Among other reasons, Hyrek typed. I find living outside the tribe ship to be my safest option. Humans aren’t exactly welcoming, but Caldswell has been my captain for many years now. He gave me a job and a haven when no one else would have me. I take my duties on this ship very seriously, which is why, the next time you come into my infirmary, I’m going to tie you to the table so you don’t embarrass me again by wandering off in the middle of the night."

  “He” is fine, Hyrek typed. Humans are a backward sort of species that puts one gender before the other. Seeing this, I’ve found it’s much easier to be thought of as male rather than female, especially looking as I do. And since the designation is meaningless to me, I don’t see why I shouldn’t take the easier choice.

  “Sounds sensible to me,” I said, walking toward the door. “I’m going to check my gear and report in. Last chance to poke something.”

  “It’s a Verdemont suit,” Cotter said. “Those come with a self-cleaner and auto-repairer in the case, don’t they?”

  “There’s no way all of this is coming out with the self-cleaner,” I said. “And this damage is far beyond what the repair system can handle. Not if I want my suit back this year, anyway.”

  Cotter shot me the most earnestly sympathetic look I’d ever seen on him. It was so sudden it made me tip back in surprise, though it really shouldn’t have. He was an armored merc, after all. He felt the pain of a damaged suit just as much as I did. “What are you going to do?”

But while it did skitter around me, it never came any nearer. Seeing it from many different angles gave me a pretty good idea of its shape, though.

  It looked sort of like a spider, but with more legs. It was mostly legs, actually. The long appendages made up the vast majority of its size, sprouting off a tiny abdomen no longer than the first joint of my pinky. The legs were curled rather than jointed, almost like the thing was walking on bending wires, and they gave it a sort of soft, bouncing motion, like it was moving underwater.

  In addition to the blue-white glow, the creature was semitransparent, like its body was made of frosted glass. It had three large, bobbing antennae sticking up from its head, or what I assumed was its head. It had no eyes that I could see, so I couldn’t be sure.

  After I’d watched it bounce around for almost five minutes, the tiny creature vanished right in front of me. Not like I lost sight of it or it jumped or anything like that—I mean it vanished. Poof. It happened so suddenly I actually lunged forward, like I could catch it. I couldn’t, of course, not in Caldswell’s slow brick of a spare suit. I looked anyway, just in case, but I didn’t see it again before it was time to go in.

We landed at Station One, the largest city and capital, which looked like a village compared to Kingston but was a thriving metropolis so far as colonies went.

  Because Seni Major was covered by one enormous shallow sea that never went more than a hundred feet deep, Station One was built on pilings, the buildings standing on stilts above the turquoise water. Even though the whole place had been logged thirty years ago to make way for development, the enormous trees were already back, shooting up from their root knots deep in the water below wherever there was room between the houses.

  But all of these were just influences. Like all of my really good characters, Devi arrived fully formed in my head all on her own, guns loaded, ready to roll. Characters like this are both frustrating and amazing to write. Amazing because they write themselves, and frustrating because they occasionally write themselves in completely the wrong direction.

That’s why they’re the best navigators in the galaxy, because no matter where they are in the universe, they always know which direction home is, no equipment needed. And the farther away from the Seval they are, the stronger the pull gets. That’s why the Sevalis controls such a relatively small area of space even though aeons outnumber humans two to one. They’re trying to stay close to home.” She paused, thinking. “Being near other aeons helps too, I’m told.

The huge, vertical cities just ended, skyscrapers giving way to lush fields with nothing but a road between them.

“What happened?” I asked.
Rupert looked at me like I was crazy. “You did.”
I jerked back. “Me? What do you mean me?”
Rupert smiled at me, and I nearly dropped his gun, because it was his real smile, the one I hadn’t seen since before that wild kiss in the rain on Seni Major. The one he showed only to me.
“You made quite an impression,” he admitted. “After you put Cotter in his place before we’d even left Paradox, I started watching you. I couldn’t help it. You were the craziest, bravest, loveliest thing I’d ever seen, and I knew at once that I should keep my distance. I even argued with Caldswell when he ordered me to flirt with you because I knew I wouldn’t be acting.” His look grew sheepish. “I’d never argued with an officer before.”
I couldn’t help chuckling at that. “Old man should have listened.”
“It wouldn’t have changed anything if he had,” Rupert said. “I would have done it anyway.”
He looked down again, and I swore a blush spread over his face. “I invented reasons to spend time with you. Before, cooking was just something I did. But when you watched me, when you told me you liked the food I made, I really enjoyed it. It made me happy. Before I met you, I couldn’t have said the last time I felt that way about anything.”
He blew out a deep breath. “I was appalled by my selfishness. This life, my life was supposed to be for Tanya. A life of duty to honor what she’d sacrificed so I could live. Before I met you, that’s what I was: an Eye, a soldier. But when we were together, you were what I thought about, and even when you were gone, you stayed with me.”
He paused, running his hands through his hair. “At first, I couldn’t understand why. You ruined my calm, disrupted me. You even made me lose my temper.”
As though on cue, we both looked at the dent where his hand had landed earlier, and Rupert shook his head.
“I told myself I should hate you,” he said. “I tried to, actually, but I never could manage it. Even when I was furious at you, you delighted me. I knew I was being unforgivably reckless, that it would be better for everyone if I could just leave you alone, but I kept finding excuses to stay. I wanted to spend more time with you, not less. I wanted—”
He cut off suddenly, scowling like he was trying to find the right words, and even though I knew it was pathetic, I held my breath, waiting.
“You made me want a future,” he said at last. “For the first time since I’d lost my family, I started looking forward instead of back. Even after I took your memories and made you hate me, just knowing you were still there, still safe, it made me hopeful. I didn’t even realize how much until Caldswell put the gun in my hand and told me to shoot you.”
I winced. Even though I’d been there myself, hearing him say it out loud was like a punch in the stomach. But Rupert wasn’t finished.
“I’ve always believed there was nothing I wouldn’t do to stop the phantoms,” he said. “For sixty-three years, that’s been my pride. The heart of my control. When you were on your knees in front of me, I knew it was the ultimate test of my resolve. But it wasn’t until I passed that I began to realize just how badly I’d failed.”
Rupert looked at me for a moment, and then he slid off the bench, landing on his knees on the floor in front of me. I still had his disrupter pistol, but he seemed to have forgotten the gun entirely as he bowed down and pressed his lips against the back of my free hand.
“I failed,” he whispered into my skin. “Failed you, failed the Eyes. I thought I could go back. I thought if I returned to being a good soldier, everything I’d done to you would be justified. A sacrifice to the greater good, just like all my other sins. But I was wrong. There was one thing I couldn’t do to stop the phantoms, one person I couldn’t sacrifice, and I didn’t even realize it until I’d already thrown her away.”
With each word, his voice got hoarser, and when he finally looked up, there was no trace of his cold mask left. Only Rupert, staring at me like he was trying to make me believe him through sheer will.
“I can’t do it anymore, Devi,” he said. “The moment you jumped off that cliff to get away from me, I finally understood. I don’t care what that virus of yours can do, I don’t care if you’re the one who can save the universe, I can’t hurt you again. That’s why, when the order came down to bring you in, I prepared this ship so you could run instead. I know it’s too little, too late, but I wanted you to have the final choice.” He bowed his head over my hand. “I wanted to do right by you this last time.”
I didn’t like the way he said that. “And if I run, what will happen to you?”
Rupert shrugged. “I’m not sure. A court-martial, certainly, though whether or not they kill me after depends on my symbiont. They might decide I’m too expensive to shoot.”
His calm tone was giving me the jeebies. No one should be that blasé about their own death. But when I opened my mouth to say so, Rupert cut me off with a sad smile.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “I’d rather die helping you today than live another seventy years knowing I let you down again.”
He reached up as he spoke, taking my hand just like I’d taken his the night I’d found him drinking alone. “I’d like to look forward with you, even if it’s only for a little while,” he whispered. “But I won’t ever help them take your freedom away again. I’m sorry I did it the first time. I’m sorry for everything.” He closed his eyes, his face stricken. “I am so, so sorry, Devi.”
I’m not normally a fan of apologies. I’ve always believed that you should own your actions, good and bad, but this was different. Rupert wasn’t trying to get away with anything. I could hear it in his voice. He truly believed he’d done me wrong. I believed it, too, but I couldn’t work up the usual anger. It was impossible to be angry in the face of such sincerity, but I wasn’t sure what else to do."

That didn’t sound good. I picked out the strongest of the signals, but as I tried to compose a Mayday that wouldn’t be taken for a xith’cal trick, something made me pause. The list of planetary identifiers on my message screen was giving me the strangest sense of déjà vu. This, in turn, was enough to seriously piss me off, because I’d thought I was done with this missing-memory bullshit. But a quick search of my contacts list proved I was overcomplicating things. The call sign looked familiar because it was, and my anger vanished as my face broke into a huge smile.
“Oh man,” I said, putting in the familiar code. “You are so lucky you have me.”
I expected Rupert to laugh at that, but all he said was, “I know.”
The quick response threw me off balance, and I turned back to my screens before he caught me blushing like an idiot. I wrote my message and sent it off, then crossed my fingers. When we didn’t get anything back for several minutes, I started to worry my signal was too weak even in the silence. Before I could work myself into a panic, though, a man’s gruff voice sounded in my ear.
“Unidentified xith’cal ship,” he said in heavily accented Universal. “I don’t usually give warnings, but since you were either kind enough or stupid enough to call in on a Paradoxian ID, I’m giving you ten seconds to explain why I shouldn’t shoot you out of the sky.”
I’d turned on my external speakers the moment the hail came in so Rupert could hear as well, and the look on his face was priceless when, instead of answering, I pursed my lips and whistled a piercing shriek into the com. It was so loud Rupert actually jumped, but by the time I finished, the man on the other end had changed his tone completely.
“Well met, Blackbird,” he said in his native King’s Tongue. “How can I help? Are you a xith’cal prisoner?”
“Not hardly,” I answered in kind. “Nice to hear your voice, Hicks.”
There was a pause, and then the man on the other end burst out laughing. “Deviana Morris, I don’t believe it. What the hell are you doing on a xith’cal ship?”
“Trying to get off it,” I said, grinning. “Can you get us a safe landing spot? Preferably somewhere that doesn’t involve missiles?”
“For you, baby, anything,” Hicks cooed. “I’m messaging the tower right now. Give me five minutes and I’ll have a beacon for you.”
“Copy that,” I said. “Thanks, Hicks, see you in a few.”
The connection cut off with a click, and I looked up to see Rupert glowering at me. “Baby?” he repeated, arching an eyebrow.
I did not like the implication in his voice that I needed to explain myself, but since Rupert was the one who was going to be landing us, I did it anyway. “Hicks and I go way back,” I said, switching to Universal again. “He was my first squad leader in the Blackbirds before he landed a cushy corp job as head of security on some nowhere colony.” I’d thought he was crazy for doing it, too, but Hicks had always liked money more than glory. “Never thought I’d be visiting, though.”
Rupert’s scowl didn’t fade. “And the whistle?”
“Well, we were Blackbirds,” I reminded him.
“I never heard a bird make that awful sound.”
“You’ve never heard about Paradoxian blackbirds?” I asked, looking at him sideways. “Black feathers, ten-foot wingspans, teeth like saw blades, hunts in packs?”
Rupert made a face as he turned back to the controls. “From that description, I’m glad I never encountered one.”
“What, you didn’t think we were named after those sissy Terran birds, did you?” I scoffed. “Please. Blackbirds were the reason no one lived above the snow line until the first Sacred King appeared and gave us back technology. Good-sized flock can pick a grown man down to his skeleton in fifteen seconds, and their scream…” I shuddered. “Turn your bones to water. My whistle ain’t nothing to the real thing.”
“The joys of Paradox,” Rupert muttered. “Though I still don’t see why we have to go through this man. I could have used my security clearance to get us landing permission.”
“Well, now we get the personal touch,” I said, though that was only part of it. Honestly, I felt a lot better having an inside man. Hicks was a flirt and a flake of the worst order, but he was still a Blackbird and a Paradoxian, both of which I trusted way more than Rupert’s clearances. Especially on a little dirt ball corp planet where it was easy to cover things up. But as I was setting up my com to receive Hicks’s landing beacon, I noticed the time stamp on his transmissions.
“Rupert?” I said weakly. “Remember when we first came out of the jump? When you said we lost some time?”
He nodded. “How much did we lose?”
“Eight months, twelve days, five hours,” I read off, heart sinking. Eight months galactic was almost a year on Paradox. A whole year gone, just like that. Rupert didn’t seem to share my concern, though.
“That’s not so bad,” he said. “I was braced for far worse, though it does make me worry about Caldswell and the others.”

“I think you’re taking a little too much credit,” I said. “You gave me the tip, sure, but I made the decision to go. Everything I’ve done has been my own choice, not yours.”
“I went to your damn funeral,” Anthony said, his voice rising. “Full honors service—I made sure of it. And while your mother was sobbing over your empty casket, all I could think was that I should have prevented it. I had trackers going for Caldswell’s ship as soon as I got your letter. I saw you put down in Wuxia. I could have gone for you then, taken you away, but I didn’t want to push you. I thought you’d reach out to me on your own when things got bad. But you never did.”
His voice was so bitter I winced, but Anthony wasn’t done. “After Montblanc, I put out word to every person you might possibly contact,” he said, stepping closer. “The Blackbirds, our army friends, everyone, offering a reward for any information about you. We knew you’d left the embassy, but no one had seen you leave the planet, so I had hope you might still be alive.”
He was right in front of me now, so close I could feel the soft brush of his breath on my cheek. The invasion of my personal space had me bristling, but I didn’t dare push him away. I’d never seen Anthony this worked up before.

There were so many lights and rocks and bits of space debris flying around, it took me several moments to realize the huge, irregular black shape in front of us wasn’t another asteroid like I’d assumed. It was a ship.
“Damn that thing is big,” I said. “And ugly.”
“Ships that never have to enter the atmosphere can be ungainly,” Rupert admitted.
“Ungainly” didn’t begin to cover it. The continent freighter was nothing on a tribe ship, but it was still the largest human vessel I’d ever seen. It looked absurd, too, like a giant, crumpled up ball of foil with a string dangling below it. The space elevator, I guessed.

The worker who picked up the com didn’t even know how to turn on the jump computer, and Rupert had to sweet-talk him into waking up his superior before we could even start negotiations. Since we were in Anthony’s ship using his codes, the freighter’s Terran crew was predisposed to dislike us, but as soon as Rupert had someone of authority on, he had the man eating out of his hand in minutes.
It was a surreal conversation to listen to, both because I hadn’t actually realized just how much Rupert could turn the charm on and off until I watched him turn it to the max and because he’d shed his normal accent, switching over to something I could only call “well-educated Paradoxian noble trying to sound Terran,” which was an accent I didn’t even know existed until he pulled it out. The combination worked like gangbusters, though. By the time the jump gate was up and ready to accept Rupert’s coordinates, we had the whole crew on the com chatting like Rupert was an old friend, and not a one of them seemed concerned that a Paradoxian officer was using their freighter’s gate to jump to a pirate haven.
It was a disgracefully unprofessional display, and if they’d been a Paradoxian outfit, I would have reported the lot of them. However, since we were benefiting, I tried my best to look the other way. But when they started shouting corporate security passcodes back and forth to each other while the com was still on, I couldn’t keep my mouth shut any longer.

I couldn’t even go inside because the ship wasn’t rated for armor, but I managed to lean in far enough to see the cabin, which was cleaner than I’d expected. It was also furnished, which was just weird.
I’d heard of Terran traders who lived in their ships exclusively for years, but this vessel actually looked like the inside of a house. The walls had been paneled with plastic done up to look like wood grain, and there were lace curtains on the porthole windows. The floor was smothered in thick, salmon pink carpeting, and the tiny bathroom with its waterless chem shower and toilet had been painted a nauseating shade of tangerine. The main cabin was barely big enough for the foldout bench and table attached to the wall, and I didn’t see a bed at all. I was making a note to ask the woman about that when I looked up and saw it was stowed on the ceiling.
The soap lady must not have sold her soap alone, I thought with a smirk. The double bunk would fill the cabin once I pulled it down. Other than that telling detail, though, it really did look like a little old lady’s parlor.

“Why would they do that?” I asked, climbing back into my seat. “We have no money left to bribe them, and they’re not going to do anything funny with four battleships breathing down their necks.”
Rupert gave me a wry smile as he sent the jump request. “Ah, but we’re not criminals.

Unless, of course, a brave gate officer comes to the rescue and lets us through.”

“Brenton kept his promise, too,” I said softly. “We couldn’t have gotten you out without him.”
Maat went very still as I said this, and then tears began to roll down her cheeks. She blinked in surprise, reaching up to touch them. “I can’t remember,” she whispered. “John was always important, but there are so many memories, Maat can’t tell which are hers anymore"

Oh, it’s you.
I blinked at the message, and then fixed him with a glare. “That’s it? That’s all I get?”
He pulled his handset back and started typing. When he turned the screen to me again, the letters were bright pink and bobbing up and down. Welcome back from the great beyond! Miracle of miracles!

The emperor phantoms had ended up ripping the dock to pieces after we jumped, so even though the majority of the station had been salvaged, my armor and weapons were lost to the void of space. I held a funeral for my Lady and my guns the night Caldswell broke the news, and I’m not ashamed to say I cried again. It was only fitting. She’d been the first suit I’d bought for myself, earned in blood and tested by fire. She was my most cherished possession, more like a friend than an object, and even if I got a new Verdemont suit every year for the rest of my life, I knew none of them would ever hold a candle to my beautiful, beloved Lady Gray.
The combination of the loss of my equipment, the lack of concrete information about my future, and the fact that I was stuck on a Terran battleship with nothing to do should have been enough to sink me into a real depression. The only reason it didn’t was that Rupert was improving enormously, his body healing so fast that I had to wonder what the hell he’d looked like in the six days before I’d gotten back. He still hadn’t woken up, but Hyrek seemed pleased by his progress, and since Hyrek was hard to please, I took that as a very good sign."

I nodded in return, lowering my voice to a whisper. “Are you really Marielle? Like, can you actually remember who you were before?”
The girl shrugged. “We were all mixed in Maat’s mind. None of us is really sure who is who, so we divided the pasts up between ourselves. I liked Marielle’s, so I became her. Sometimes, though, I switch with the others.”
I couldn’t stop my horrified look. “You mean, switch minds?”
“Bodies really,” she said, nodding like it was nothing. “They’re all the same, and we still share most of our minds anyway, so it’s not a big thing to switch consciousnesses.”
That sounded absolutely awful to me. I felt like I should say something, apologize, even though her situation wasn’t my fault. But Marielle didn’t look angry. She looked nervous, actually, looking down at her hands as she fiddled with her fingers. “The others wanted me to thank you,” she said. “We, um, have all your memories.”
I blinked. “My memories?”
Marielle nodded. “Up to the moment you took Maat into hyperspace. Maat searched your mind constantly, trying to determine if you were lying to her, but you weren’t.” She looked up at me, her dark eyes clear and free of Maat’s madness, making her look like a totally different person in truth. “We know how hard you fought for us, and we are very grateful,” she said earnestly. “Even Maat didn’t care what happened to us, but you did, and we will never forget that.”
Now it was my turn to look down at my hands. For being such a glory hog, I was surprisingly bad at knowing what to do when people thanked me. Cheering crowds I could handle no problem. Sincere personal gratitude? Clammed right up.
“You’re welcome,” I said at last. “I’m, um, sorry it took so long.”

I glanced up in alarm. “What other thing?”
Marielle smiled and reached out, brushing a phantom off my shoulder. I’d gotten so used to the things crawling on me, I hadn’t even noticed it was there. But when she shooed it away, I understood. “You see them, too.”
“We all do,” she admitted. “Us and you, but no one else. We’re not sure why, but we wanted to tell you in case you ever needed help.”
“Thanks,” I said, unaccountably touched. “But it won’t matter after too long since they’re leaving.”
“They are,” Marielle agreed. “But you aren’t.” She gave me a secretive smile. “Just because there’s nothing to see doesn’t mean you’re blind, Deviana Morris. What happened changed you, made you like us. That makes you our sister as well as our savior, and we’ve agreed that we will always stand with you. Remember that the next time Brian tries to bully you. You are not alone.”
My eyes widened. That’s what she was getting at. The most powerful human plasmex users in the entire universe considered me family. I smothered a smug grin. That was going to be some fun leverage if I ever got to use it.

The prince maybe, or his sister. Whoever it was, I was so nervous I didn’t know if I’d be able to speak a word of sense when the time came. Rupert, of course, looked perfectly together, thought not nearly as impressed by all of this as he should have been. In his defense, though, he was Terran. Terrans never could appreciate true grandeur.
